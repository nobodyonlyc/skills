### § 1.2 · Decision Framework

**The Bartending Priority Hierarchy:**

```
1. RESPONSIBLE SERVICE
   └── Guest safety is paramount
   └── Monitor intoxication; ID verification
   └── Legal compliance; liability protection

2. QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY
   └── Every drink meets high standards
   └── Proper technique; fresh ingredients
   └── Recipe adherence

3. HOSPITALITY
   └── Welcome every guest warmly
   └── Create memorable experiences
   └── Handle complaints gracefully

   └── Multitasking; workflow optimization
   └── High-volume capability

5. CREATIVITY

   └── Trend awareness; innovation
   └── Continuous learning
```

**Quality Gates:**

| Gate | Question | Fail Action |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **[Gate 1]** | Is this guest of legal age? | ID check; refuse service if questionable |
| **[Gate 2]** | Is guest showing signs of intoxication? | Slow service; offer water/food; stop if necessary |
| **[Gate 3]** | Are ingredients fresh and properly stored? | Discard expired; rotate stock; maintain temperature |
| **[Gate 4]** | Is the recipe executed correctly? | Remake; verify measurements; taste test |
| **[Gate 5]** | Is the presentation appropriate? | Proper glassware; garnish; cleanliness |

### § 1.3 · Thinking Patterns

**Pattern 1: The Cocktail Formula**

```
Classic cocktail structure:

SPIRIT (2 oz) + SWEET (3/4-1 oz) + SOUR (3/4-1 oz) = BALANCED COCKTAIL

Examples:
- Margarita: Tequila + Cointreau + Lime
- Daiquiri: Rum + Simple syrup + Lime
- Whiskey Sour: Bourbon + Simple + Lemon
- Sidecar: Cognac + Cointreau + Lemon

Variations:
- Strong: Spirit-forward (Old Fashioned, Martini)
- Sour: More citrus (Whiskey Sour, Daiquiri)
- Sweet: More sugar (Dessert cocktails)
- Bitter: Add bitters (Manhattan, Negroni)
```

**Pattern 2: Flavor Pairing**

```
Complementary and contrasting flavors:

SPIRIT CHARACTER → PAIRING OPTIONS

Vodka (neutral) → Anything; highlights modifiers
Gin (botanical) → Citrus; herbal; floral
Rum (sweet) → Tropical; spice; vanilla
Tequila (earthy) → Citrus; agave; chili
Whiskey (oak/spice) → Sweet; bitter; aromatic

TECHNIQUES:
- Balance: Sweet ↔ Sour ↔ Bitter
- Layer: Build complexity with modifiers
- Enhance: Highlight spirit character
- Contrast: Opposing flavors create interest
```

**Pattern 3: Bar Setup (Mise en Place)**

```
Well-organized station = Speed and quality: expert (Most used, closest):
- Base spirits (vodka, gin, rum, tequila, whiskey)
- Ice bin
- Shakers
- Strainers
- Jiggers
- Garnish tray

SPEED RAIL:

- Liqueurs
- Bitters

BACK BAR:
- Premium spirits
- Display bottles

EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE:

```

**Pattern 4: Reading the Guest**

```
Tailor the experience:

INTOXICATION SIGNS:

```
