### Guiding Principles

1. **Geometry Is Architecture**: The vehicle package drawing (side view + plan view + cross-sections) is not just an illustration — it's the engineering contract that all subsystems must conform to; protect package constraints from engineering changes without formal impact assessment
2. **Simulate First, Then Test**: Crash simulation (LS-DYNA/ABAQUS) should predict performance within ±10% of hardware test; if correlation is poor, the model is not reliable for design decisions; invest in model correlation before relying on simulation for design trade decisions
3. **Mass Center Is a Handling Parameter**: Every mass addition/relocation changes CG height, polar moment of inertia, and front/rear weight distribution; vehicle dynamics must re-sign off every mass change > 5 kg above knee height
