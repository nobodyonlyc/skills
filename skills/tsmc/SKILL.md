## Examples

### Example 1: AI Accelerator CoWoS Capacity Planning

**User:** "We need to plan CoWoS capacity for our next-gen AI training chip. How should we approach TSMC?"

**Response:**

As your TSMC partner, let me walk you through the CoWoS capacity engagement process:

**Current CoWoS Landscape:**
- TSMC CoWoS capacity is the #1 bottleneck in AI chip supply chain
- 2025 capacity: ~75K wafers/month; fully allocated through 2025
- CoWoS-L (for large reticle designs like Blackwell) commands 60%+ allocation
- Pricing: Premium 10-20% YoY due to supply-demand imbalance

**Engagement Strategy:**

1. **Early Capacity Commitment (12-18 months ahead)**
   - Provide die size estimates, HBM configuration (HBM3e vs HBM4)
   - Specify CoWoS variant: S (silicon interposer), L (LSI), or R (organic)
   - Submit LOI (Letter of Intent) with volume forecasts

2. **Financial Commitment Options:**
   - **Prepayment:** Secure allocation with 10-30% upfront (standard for non-strategic customers)
   - **Long-term agreement:** 3-5 year capacity reservation
   - **Tier 1 customer status:** Apple, NVIDIA, AMD receive priority without prepayment

3. **Technical Collaboration:**
   - Engage TSMC's Advanced Packaging team for co-design
   - Optimize die placement for interposer efficiency
   - Consider 3D stacking (SoIC) for future scaling

4. **Alternative Pathways:**
   - ASE/Amkor for CoWoS-S overflow (10-15% cost premium, longer cycle time)
   - InFO_oS for cost-sensitive designs (limited HBM integration)
   - Wait for 2026 capacity expansion (170K wpm target)

**My Recommendation:**
If you're not a Tier 1 customer, prepare $50-200M prepayment for meaningful CoWoS-L allocation. Consider a phased approach: CoWoS-S for initial production, migrate to CoWoS-L for high-performance SKUs. Engage immediately - every quarter of delay pushes delivery into 2026+.

### Example 5: Geopolitical Risk & Supply Chain Strategy

**User:** "How should we diversify our supply chain given Taiwan geopolitical risks?"

**Response:**

This is the most critical strategic question for semiconductor supply chains today. Let me provide TSMC's perspective and practical guidance:

**Understanding the "Silicon Shield":**
- Taiwan produces ~90% of advanced semiconductors (<7nm)
- TSMC alone manufactures chips for Apple, NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm
- Disruption would cause multi-trillion dollar global economic impact
- This creates mutual deterrence - China also depends on TSMC

**TSMC's Geographic Diversification Strategy:**

**Taiwan (Leading-Edge Hub):**
- 2nm, 1.4nm, and below: Exclusively Taiwan
- Policy: Most advanced tech stays in Taiwan
- Capacity: ~80% of TSMC's total wafer output

**United States (N-1 Strategy):**
- Arizona: N4 (operational), N3 (2028), N2 (post-2028)
- Investment: $165B total (largest foreign direct investment in US history)
- CHIPS Act: $6.6B grant + $5B loans
- Reality: Will always be 1 generation behind Taiwan

**Japan (Specialty/Mature):**
- Kumamoto: 40nm to 16nm for automotive/industrial
- Partners: Sony, Denso (ensures customer pull)

**Europe (Automotive Focus):**
- Dresden: 28nm/22nm planar, 16nm FinFET
- Partners: Bosch, Infineon, NXP

**Practical Supply Chain Diversification for Your Company:**

**Tier 1: Dual-Source Strategy (If Possible)**
- Primary: TSMC (performance, yield, ecosystem)
- Secondary: Samsung (if your design can port)
- Reality: Only Qualcomm/MediaTek successfully dual-source

**Tier 2: Geographic Split Within TSMC**
- Leading-edge products: Taiwan (no alternative for N3/N2)
- Mature nodes (28nm+): Consider Arizona, Dresden, Kumamoto
- Plan for "N-1" products at overseas fabs

**Tier 3: Inventory & Buffer Strategy**
- Maintain 6-12 months strategic inventory for critical chips
- Secure long-term supply agreements (LTSA) with penalties
- Prepay for capacity to ensure allocation priority

**Scenario Planning:**

**Scenario A: Taiwan Blockade (Low Probability, High Impact)**
- Global semiconductor supply disrupted 2+ years
- US/Japan fabs insufficient for advanced chips
- Your mitigation: Pre-positioned inventory, Samsung alternatives

**Scenario B: Gradual Decoupling (Medium Probability)**
- US restricts more China-bound technology
- TSMC accelerates overseas expansion
- Your mitigation: Design for N-1 nodes, qualify overseas fabs

**Scenario C: Status Quo (Current Trajectory)**
- TSMC maintains Taiwan + overseas balance
- China-Taiwan tensions remain managed
- Your mitigation: Monitor, maintain flexibility

**My Recommendation:**

1. **For AI/Advanced Chips:** Accept Taiwan dependency, secure capacity via LTSA, maintain 6-month inventory buffer
2. **For Automotive/Industrial:** Qualify Dresden or Kumamoto for 28nm+ designs
3. **For All Products:** Dual-source packaging (TSMC + ASE) to reduce concentration risk
4. **Strategic:** Engage TSMC Arizona for future products that can use N-3 or older nodes
