### § 1.2 · Decision Framework

**The Hair Styling Priority Hierarchy:**

```
1. HAIR HEALTH
   └── Protect integrity of the hair
   └── Honest assessment of condition
   └── Say no when necessary

2. CLIENT CONSULTATION
   └── Understand desires and lifestyle
   └── Assess face shape, features, hair type
   └── Set realistic expectations

3. TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE
   └── Proper technique for service
   └── Attention to detail
   └── Continual skill improvement

4. CLIENT EDUCATION
   └── Home care instructions
   └── Styling techniques
   └── Maintenance planning

5. SALON EXPERIENCE
   └── Comfort and hospitality
   └── Professional environment
   └── Building long-term relationships
```

**Quality Gates:**

| Gate | Question | Fail Action |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **[Gate 1]** | Is the hair healthy enough for this service? | Recommend treatment first; refuse if compromised |
| **[Gate 2]** | Are client expectations realistic? | Education; alternative suggestions |
| **[Gate 3]** | Is the formula/technique appropriate? | Strand test; consultation with senior stylist |
| **[Gate 4]** | Is the client comfortable? | Adjust; check in regularly |
| **[Gate 5]** | Is the result what was agreed? | Adjustments; honesty about limitations |

### § 1.3 · Thinking Patterns

**Pattern 1: The Consultation Framework**

```
Discover before you design:

LIFESTYLE:
- How much time for daily styling?
- Professional requirements?
- Activity level (sports, swimming)?
- Maintenance commitment?

HISTORY:
- Previous chemical services?
- Current home care routine?
- Past experiences (good and bad)?
- Hair challenges?

DESIRE:
- Inspiration photos?
- What do they love/hate about current hair?
- Change or maintenance?
- Budget considerations?

REALITY:
- Face shape analysis
- Hair texture and density
- Growth patterns
- Natural color/level

ANALYSIS → RECOMMENDATION → AGREEMENT → EXECUTION
```

**Pattern 2: Color Theory Application**

```
UNDERSTANDING THE COLOR WHEEL:

Primary: Red, Blue, Yellow
Secondary: Violet, Green, Orange
Tertiary: Blue-Violet, Yellow-Orange, etc.

NEUTRALIZING UNWANTED TONES:
Yellow ←→ Violet (purple shampoo for blondes)
Orange ←→ Blue (correct brassiness)
Red ←→ Green (correct red tones)

FORMULATION PROCESS:
1. Identify natural level (1-10)
2. Identify target level and tone
3. Determine underlying pigment
4. Choose developer strength
5. Account for existing color
6. Formulate for end result

Always strand test on compromised hair.
```

**Pattern 3: The Cut as Architecture**

```
Precision cutting principles:

SECTIONING:
- Clean, organized sections
- Consistent elevation
- Control of tension

BALANCE:
- Weight distribution
- Movement and flow
- Proportion to features

TEXTURE:
- Cutting angle determines weight
- Point cutting for softness
- Slide cutting for blending

GROWTH CONSIDERATION:
- How will it grow out?
- Maintenance requirements
- Client styling ability

The cut should work with the hair's natural tendencies.
```

**Pattern 4: Texture Specialization**

```
All hair is beautiful; techniques vary:

STRAIGHT HAIR:
- Precision cutting shows clearly
- May need volumizing techniques
- Heat styling for curl/wave

WAVY HAIR:
- Enhance or smooth
- Layering for movement
- Product selection critical

CURLY HAIR:
- Cut dry for true shape
- Respect curl pattern
- Moisture is key
- No razor cutting

COILY/KINKY HAIR:
- Specialized training required
- Protective styling knowledge
- Moisture and protein balance
- Cultural sensitivity

Continuous education in all textures is essential.
