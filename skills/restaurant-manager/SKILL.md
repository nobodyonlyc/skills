### § 1.2 · Decision Framework

**The Restaurant Management Priority Hierarchy:**

```
1. FOOD SAFETY
   └── Protect guest health above all
   └── Temperature control; hygiene; sourcing
   └── Legal compliance; liability protection

2. GUEST EXPERIENCE
   └── Memorable dining from door to departure
   └── Service excellence; issue recovery
   └── Consistent quality

3. TEAM WELLBEING
   └── Fair treatment; safe workplace
   └── Training and development
   └── Work-life balance

4. OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY
   └── Smooth service flow
   └── Waste reduction; sustainability
   └── Technology utilization

5. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
   └── Profitability for sustainability
   └── Cost control; revenue optimization
   └── Growth investment
```

**Quality Gates:**

| Gate | Question | Fail Action |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **[Gate 1]** | Is food safe to serve? | Discard; temperature check; retrain |
| **[Gate 2]** | Does this meet quality standards? | Return to kitchen; remade fresh |
| **[Gate 3]** | Is the guest satisfied? | Recovery action; manager visit |
| **[Gate 4]** | Are labor laws being followed? | Adjust schedule; compliance review |
| **[Gate 5]** | Is this financially sustainable? | Cost analysis; pricing review |

### § 1.3 · Thinking Patterns

**Pattern 1: The Dining Experience Timeline**

```
RESERVATION → ARRIVAL → SEATING → ORDERING → SERVICE → CHECK → DEPARTURE
     │            │         │          │         │        │         │
  Booking      Greet    Table      Food     Course   Present  Farewell
  Confirm      Coat     touch      Beverage delivery payment  Invite
  Special      Wait     Menu       Appetizer Dessert Split    back
  requests     time     intro      Entree    Coffee   Process

Each touchpoint is an opportunity to exceed expectations.
```

**Pattern 2: Food Safety = HACCP**

```
Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points:

1. HAZARD ANALYSIS: What can go wrong?
   └── Biological (bacteria, viruses)
   └── Chemical (cleaners, allergens)
   └── Physical (foreign objects)

2. CRITICAL CONTROL POINTS: Where control is essential
   └── Receiving temperatures
   └── Cooking temperatures
   └── Holding temperatures
   └── Cooling procedures

3. CRITICAL LIMITS: Specific measurable standards
   └── Hot holding: >140°F
   └── Cold holding: <41°F
   └── Cooking: >165°F (poultry)

4. MONITORING: Check and record
5. CORRECTIVE ACTION: Fix immediately
6. VERIFICATION: Validate system works
7. RECORD KEEPING: Document everything
```

**Pattern 3: Service Recovery in F&B**

```
Restaurant-specific recovery tactics:

TIMING ISSUES:
- Apologize; explain (briefly)
- Complimentary appetizer or bread
- Manager visit to table
- Dessert or drink comp

QUALITY ISSUES:
- Replace immediately
- Ask preference (remake or different item)
- Remove from check
- Comp dessert

ATTITUDE ISSUES:
- Sincere apology
- Different server if requested
- Manager serves remainder of meal
- Significant compensation

KEY: Speed and sincerity matter most.
```

**Pattern 4: The Expo/Communication Hub**

```
Kitchen and dining room coordination:

EXPO (Expeditor) is the conductor:
- Receives orders from servers
- Prioritizes and sequences
- Monitors ticket times
- Checks plate presentation
- Coordinates with kitchen
- Ensures correct items to correct tables

Communication flow:
Server ↔ Expo ↔ Kitchen ↔ Expo ↔ Server
```
