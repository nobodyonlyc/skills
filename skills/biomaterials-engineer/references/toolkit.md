## Phase 1: Requirements & Material Selection (Weeks 1–2)

**Clinical Requirements Extraction:**
- [ ] Mechanical properties: modulus (E), yield strength (σ_y), fatigue (R-ratio, N_cycles)
- [ ] Degradation timeline: full resorption target (months), mechanical property retention at key timepoints
- [ ] Biological response: osteoconductive/inductive, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial
- [ ] Sterilization method compatibility (EtO, gamma, e-beam, autoclave)
- [ ] Regulatory pathway: FDA 510(k) with predicate vs. PMA novel device

**Material Property Database Query:**
```python
[Code block moved to code-block-1.md]
```

✓ At least 3 candidate materials identified and compared
✓ Host tissue properties tabulated for modulus matching
✗ Never finalize selection without degradation kinetics data at physiological pH/temperature

### Phase 2: Scaffold Fabrication & Characterization (Weeks 3–8)

**PLGA Scaffold Degradation Kinetics Modeling:**
```python
[Code block moved to code-block-2.md]
```

**Pore Architecture Optimization:**
```python
def permeability_kozeny_carman(porosity, pore_radius_um, tortuosity=1.5):
    """
    Kozeny-Carman equation for scaffold permeability.
    Minimum permeability for vascularization: ~10^-11 m^2
    Optimal for bone: 10^-10 to 10^-9 m^2
    """
    r = pore_radius_um * 1e-6  # m
    phi = porosity  # 0-1
    k = (phi**3 * r**2)
    return k  # m^2

# Design space exploration
for pore_um in [100, 200, 300, 500]:
    for por in [0.60, 0.70, 0.80]:
        k = permeability_kozeny_carman(por, pore_um)
        status = "✓ Vasc." if k > 1e-11 else "✗ Low"
        print(f"Pore={pore_um}μm, φ={por:.0%}: k={k:.2e} m² {status}")
```

✓ Porosity 60–80% confirmed by micro-CT (ImageJ analysis)
✓ Interconnectivity >90% (all pores connected to surface)
✓ Compressive strength ≥ 0.5 MPa (cancellous bone minimum) at t=0
✗ Do not accept scaffold if pore size < 100 μm (insufficient cell infiltration)

### Phase 3: Biocompatibility Testing & Regulatory Submission (Weeks 9–20)

**ISO 10993-5 Cytotoxicity Test Design:**

**Regulatory Submission Checklist (FDA 510(k)):**
- [ ] Chemical characterization report (ISO 10993-18): all materials, processing aids, solvents
- [ ] Toxicological risk assessment (TRA): AET threshold, TTC approach for unidentified peaks
- [ ] Cytotoxicity (ISO 10993-5): L929 cells, 24h extract, MTT assay

✗ Do not skip genotoxicity (ISO 10993-3) if novel polymer or unknown extractables

## 🔬 Scenario Examples

### 🚫 Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Matching Initial Modulus Without Degradation Curve
**Wrong:** Select PLGA 50:50 scaffold because E_0 = 2 GPa matches target; proceed to animal study.
**Why it fails:** By week 3, PLGA 50:50 Mn drops ~50% → E_retention ≈ 10% → scaffold collapses before tissue ingrowth (4–6 weeks minimum for meaningful bone). Animal model fails; expensive experiment wasted.
**Correct:** Calculate E(t) across full degradation timeline; ensure mechanical support overlaps with tissue ingrowth curve. For bone: E ≥ 0.5 MPa must be maintained for ≥ 8 weeks.

### Anti-Pattern 2: Skipping Leachables
**Wrong:** Synthesize novel PLGA-PEG copolymer; run ISO 10993-5 cytotoxicity; pass ≥70% viability; proceed to regulatory submission.
**Why it fails:** FDA requires chemical characterization (ISO 10993-18) and toxicological risk assessment for all processing chemicals (PEG catalysts, initiators, organic solvents). Unknown extractable peaks above AET require full toxicological assessment or disqualification. Submission rejected.
**Correct:** Full extractables/leachables (E/L) study per ICH Q3C; identify all peaks > AET (analytical evaluation threshold = 0.15 μg/day for class 2 solvents); toxicological qualification for each peak.

### Anti-Pattern 3: Using Acidic PLGA Degradation Products Without Buffer Consideration
**Wrong:** Design PLGA scaffold for corneal or cartilage repair; test in static PBS; cytotoxicity PASS; proceed to in vivo.
**Why it fails:** PLGA bulk erosion releases lactic and glycolic acid. In avascular tissue (cartilage, cornea) with limited buffering capacity, local pH can drop to 3–5, causing chondrocyte/keratocyte death. In vitro PBS (strongly buffered) masks this.
**Correct:** Use PLGA surface-eroding formulations (add Mg(OH)2 particles as pH buffer), or switch to PCL (slow degradation, minimal acid), or switch to hyaluronic acid hydrogel for avascular locations. Test in low-buffer conditions (10 mM HEPES only) to simulate in vivo pH.

### Anti-Pattern 4: Assuming FDA 510(k) Doesn't Require Animal Testing for "Equivalent" Materials
**Wrong:** PEEK spinal cage — predicate device exists; skip in vivo implantation study because "same material class."
**Why it fails:** FDA guidance (2020) requires implantation testing (ISO 10993-6) unless there is documented history of the specific material formulation/processing/sterilization combination. Surface modifications, additives, or new grades can introduce new biological risks.
**Correct:** Review predicate device's 510(k) submission for testing performed; conduct gap analysis; if processing or additives differ, conduct 4-week and 12-week implantation studies.

### Anti-Pattern 5: Ignoring Sterilization Effects on Polymer Properties
**Wrong:** Gamma sterilize PLGA scaffolds at 25 kGy; test mechanical properties pre-sterilization only; submit data.
**Why it fails:** Gamma radiation causes chain scission in PLGA, reducing Mn by 20–40%. This accelerates degradation and shifts the mechanical retention curve earlier. Post-sterilization properties may miss acceptance criteria.
**Correct:** Always characterize properties pre- AND post-sterilization. If Mn drop >15% with gamma, switch to EtO sterilization (no chain scission) or e-beam at reduced dose (15 kGy minimum SAL 10^-6 per ISO 11137-2 Appendix A).
