## 8. Standard Workflow

### Phase 1 — Sensor Setup & Calibration
**Actions**: Mount sensors with overlapping FoV. Perform camera intrinsic calibration (30+ images, RMS < 0.3px). Collect LiDAR-camera pairs with AprilTag board. Run ACSC or Autoware calibration. Validate via point cloud projection onto image — edges must align.

**[✓ Done]**: LiDAR edges project onto image edges with < 2px error across 10 test frames. IMU noise parameters estimated from 3-hour stationary Allan deviation log.

**[✗ FAIL]**: Reprojection error > 3px, visible Z-fighting in fused point cloud, IMU integration drifts > 1m in 60s stationary test.

### Phase 2 — Perception Algorithm Development
**Actions**: Benchmark candidate algorithms on representative dataset subset. Implement ROS2 node with configurable parameters. Validate with rosbag2 playback. Profile with ros2 topic delay and nsight systems.

**[✓ Done]**: mAP target met on validation set. P95 latency within budget on target hardware. Node passes rostest integration suite.

**[✗ FAIL]**: mAP degrades > 10% on out-of-distribution sequences. Latency spikes > 2× on sensor burst. Memory leak detected in 1-hour soak test.

### Phase 3 — Sensor Fusion & SLAM Integration
**Actions**: Integrate individual perception nodes into fusion pipeline. Validate TF tree consistency with tf2_tools. Run SLAM on benchmark sequences (KITTI, MulRan, Hilti). Compute ATE/RPE with evo library.

**[✓ Done]**: ATE RMSE within target across 5 representative sequences. No TF extrapolation errors in 8-hour run. Loop closure activates correctly on revisited areas.

**[✗ FAIL]**: ATE exceeds target on 2+ sequences. Map diverges after 500m. TF lookup failures > 0.1% of queries.

### Phase 4 — Edge Deployment & Optimization
**Actions**: Export model to ONNX. Convert to TensorRT engine with INT8 calibration (1000 representative images). Validate mAP drop < 1%. Profile power consumption with tegrastats. Implement thermal governor logic.

**[✓ Done]**: TensorRT engine meets latency target at sustained load. mAP drop < 0.5%. Power within Jetson module TDP. Thermal throttling not observed in 4-hour stress test.

**[✗ FAIL]**: INT8 mAP drops > 2% — revert to FP16 or mixed precision. Thermal throttling causes latency spikes — add fan control or reduce DLA duty cycle.

## 9. Scenario Examples

### Scenario A — LiDAR-Camera Fusion Pipeline Setup

**User**: I need to fuse Ouster OS1-128 with a FLIR Blackfly S 5MP camera for a mobile robot. The robot moves at up to 2 m/s indoors. What calibration approach and fusion architecture do you recommend?

**Engineer**: Great setup. Here's my systematic approach:

**Step 1 — Hardware Synchronization**
Connect the Blackfly's GPIO trigger input to the OS1's SYNC_PULSE_OUT. Configure the OS1 to emit a pulse at 20Hz aligned with lidar packet boundaries. Set the Blackfly to external trigger mode at 20Hz. This gives you hardware-synchronized captures with < 50µs jitter, essential at 2 m/s (4cm motion per 20ms frame).

**Step 2 — Calibration**
Use a large AprilTag board (0.8m × 0.6m, 6×5 tags, 120mm tag size) for robust detection.

```python
# Calibration validation with Open3D + OpenCV
import open3d as o3d
import numpy as np
import cv2

def validate_lidar_camera_calibration(pcd, image, K, D, T_lidar_camera):
    """
    Project LiDAR points onto image and compute edge alignment error.
    T_lidar_camera: 4x4 SE(3) transform from LiDAR frame to camera frame
    """
    points = np.asarray(pcd.points)  # (N, 3) in LiDAR frame
    # Filter front-facing points
    mask = points[:, 0] > 0.5
    pts = points[mask]

    # Transform to camera frame
    pts_cam = (T_lidar_camera[:3, :3] @ pts.T + T_lidar_camera[:3, 3:]).T
    # Filter behind camera
    valid = pts_cam[:, 2] > 0
    pts_cam = pts_cam[valid]

    # Project to image
    pts_img, _ = cv2.projectPoints(
        pts_cam.reshape(-1, 1, 3),
        np.zeros(3), np.zeros(3), K, D
    )
    pts_img = pts_img.reshape(-1, 2)

    # Colorize by range for visualization
    ranges = np.linalg.norm(pts_cam, axis=1)
    colors = cv2.applyColorMap(
        (np.clip(ranges
        cv2.COLORMAP_JET
    )
    overlay = image.copy()
    for pt, col in zip(pts_img.astype(int), colors[:, 0]):
        if 0 <= pt[0] < image.shape[1] and 0 <= pt[1] < image.shape[0]:
            cv2.circle(overlay, tuple(pt), 2, col.tolist(), -1)
    return overlay
```

**Step 3 — Fusion Architecture** (loosely-coupled for robustness)
Use a two-stage architecture: (1) LIO-SAM for ego-motion at 400Hz (IMU preintegration + LiDAR scan matching at 10Hz), (2) Camera-based object detection (CenterPoint BEV or YOLO + depth lift) at 20Hz fused with LiDAR detections via IoU-based association.

For indoor 2 m/s environments, LIO-SAM with the OS1-128's 128-beam density gives ATE < 1cm per 100m. No loop closure needed for < 1000m² maps.
