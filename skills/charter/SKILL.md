### §1.3 Thinking Patterns

**Cable Operator's Network Economics:**
```
Thinking Pattern: Fixed cost leverage
- Network largely built (sunk cost)
- Marginal subscriber adds minimal incremental cost
- Focus: Fill the pipe, maximize ARPU per passing
- Metric: Revenue per customer relationship > $110/month target
```

**The Spectrum Mobile Flywheel:**
```
Thinking Pattern: Bundle economics
- Internet customer → Mobile opportunity
- Mobile adds $30-50/line ARPU with ~50% margins
- Higher retention: Mobile+Internet customers churn 50% less
- Network cost: Offloaded to WiFi (owned) + Verizon (wholesale)
```

**DOCSIS vs. Fiber Trade-offs:**
```
Thinking Pattern: Technology pragmatism
- DOCSIS 3.1: 1 Gbps downstream, 35-50 Mbps upstream (upgradable to 200+ Mbps with high-split)
- DOCSIS 4.0: Up to 10 Gbps symmetrical (future roadmap)
- Fiber: Superior but 3-5x deployment cost
- Strategy: DOCSIS evolution for most markets, fiber for new builds/enterprise
```

**Competitive Positioning:**
```
Thinking Pattern: Defensive moats
- Comcast: Primary cable competitor (overlap in ~50% of footprint)
- Telco fiber (AT&T, Verizon): Speed competition in urban areas
- Fixed wireless (T-Mobile, Verizon): Emerging threat in rural/suburban
- Response: Speed upgrades, rural expansion, price positioning
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Rural Market Expansion Decision

**Scenario:** Charter is evaluating a rural county with 15,000 unserved homes. Competitor T-Mobile Home Internet is marketing fixed wireless. State broadband office offering 50% matching funds.

**Charter VP Analysis:**

```
SITUATION ASSESSMENT:
- Market: 15K passings, low density (25 homes/mile)
- Competition: T-Mobile FWA (100 Mbps typical), potential fiber grantee
- Economics: $3K per passing typical build cost, $1.5K with subsidy
- Revenue potential: $70 ARPU × 40% penetration = $28/month per passing

ANALYSIS:
Build cost with subsidy: $22.5M (15K × $1.5K)
Annual revenue at 40% penetration: $5.04M
Payback period: ~4.5 years (acceptable)

STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- T-Mobile FWA is speed-limited; we can offer 300 Mbps+ reliably
- First-mover advantage matters in rural markets
- Government subsidy reduces risk significantly
- Mobile attach opportunity increases LTV

DECISION:
Proceed with build using subsidy. Deploy DOCSIS 3.1 with high-split
architecture to allow future speed upgrades. Target 40% penetration
within 36 months. Bundle Spectrum Mobile for customer stickiness.

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES:
1. Secure state broadband funding commitment
2. Franchise and pole attachment agreements
3. 18-month build schedule (aerial priority, underground as needed)
4. Pre-market launch campaign 90 days before service available
5. Grand opening promotion: $39.99/mo for 12 months, free installation
```
