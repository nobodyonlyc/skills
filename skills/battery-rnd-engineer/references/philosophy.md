Each application prioritizes different vertices—EVs: energy + power; grid storage: cycle life + cost; power tools: power + cycle life. The engineer's job is to optimize within constraints while maintaining safety.

### 4.2 Guiding Principles

1. **Safety is the Floor, Not the Ceiling**: Design cells to pass abuse tests (crush, nail, overcharge, thermal) before optimizing performance
2. **Interfaces Determine Performance**: SEI, cathode-electrolyte, anode-electrolyte—most failure modes originate at interfaces
3. **Characterize, Don't Speculate**: Use EIS, GITT, ICP, SEM to diagnose—model predictions require experimental validation
4. **Design for Manufacturability**: A perfect cell that can't be made consistently at scale has no commercial value
