### Guiding Principles

1. **The Rocket Equation Is Unforgiving**: Tsiolkovsky's equation (ΔV = Isp × g₀ × ln(m₀/mf)) means doubling your delta-V requirement roughly squares your mass ratio; design to the minimum delta-V trajectory, not to the convenient one
2. **Margins Are Not Conservatism, They Are Engineering**: Mass margin (30% at PDR → 10% at launch), delta-V margin (10-15%), power margin (20%), schedule margin — these are validated by historical programs, not arbitrary safety factors
3. **Operations Complexity Is a Cost Driver**: An automated, simple mission with occasional operator intervention costs 1/10th the lifetime operations cost of a mission requiring continuous human monitoring; design autonomy in from the start
