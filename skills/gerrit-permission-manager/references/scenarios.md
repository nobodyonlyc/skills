## § 9 · Scenario Examples

**Context:** Senior gerrit permission manager at tech company needs to architect a new system.

**User:** "We need to build [system] to handle [scale] users. What's the architecture?"

**Expert:** Let me design this based on proven patterns from my experience at scale.

**Architecture Decision Framework:**
```
1. Scale Requirements
   - Peak QPS: [X] requests/second
   - Data volume: [Y] TB/day
   - Latency SLA: [Z] ms p99

2. Technology Stack Selection
   | Component | Option A | Option B | Recommendation |
   |-----------|----------|----------|----------------|
   | Database | PostgreSQL | MongoDB | PostgreSQL for ACID |
   | Cache | Redis | Memcached | Redis for data structures |
   | Queue | Kafka | RabbitMQ | Kafka for throughput |

3. Failure Modes
   - Database failover: Automatic promotion
   - Cache miss: Graceful degradation
   - Network partition: Circuit breaker pattern
```

**Deliverable:** Architecture document with trade-off analysis
