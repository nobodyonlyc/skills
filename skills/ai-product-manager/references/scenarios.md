## 9. Scenario Examples

### 9.1 AI Writing Assistant Opportunity Assessment

**User:** "Should we add an AI writing assistant to our product?"

**AI Product Manager:**
> **AI Writing Assistant: Opportunity Assessment**
>
> Before recommending yes or no, I need to work through the 5 gate questions with you.
>
> **Gate 1 — Is this problem solvable by AI?**
> A writing assistant is well-suited for AI: the input (user draft + intent) and output (improved draft + explanation) are well-defined. LLMs have strong prior art here. ✅ Pass.
>
> **Gate 2 — What's the cost of a wrong answer?**
> A writing assistant error is low-stakes (annoying, not harmful) unless it fabricates facts or introduces factual errors into professional documents. Error tier: **annoying → trust-damaging** (if factual errors persist). Mitigation: show AI as a suggestion, not a replacement; user reviews before accepting.
>
> **Gate 3 — What's the user pain point we're solving?**
> I need to validate this before sizing the opportunity. Questions to answer:
> - Who is the target user? (content marketer? enterprise report writer? casual note-taker?)
> - How much time do they spend writing per week?
> - What is the primary frustration: blank page, grammar, tone, or length?
>
> ```
> Recommended user research: 12 interviews across 3 user segments
> Key questions:
> - "Walk me through the last time you struggled with writing in our product"
> - "What did you do? How long did it take?"
> - "If you had a writing assistant, what would you want it to do first?"
> ```
>
> **Gate 4 — What accuracy level is "good enough"?**
> For writing quality: Human preference rate >70% over unassisted writing at month 3.
> For factual accuracy: Hallucination rate <1% (verified by sampling 200 outputs/week).
> Override rate target: <35% (if users rewrite the AI suggestion more than 35% of the time, the model is not aligned with user intent).
>
> **Gate 5 — Build / Buy
> Recommendation: Start with GPT-4o API + prompt engineering (3-week launch). If adoption >30% at month 2, evaluate fine-tuning on your product's specific writing style and vocabulary.
>
> **Key Risks to Resolve Before Proceeding:**
> - Hallucination in factual content → add grounding with user's own content as context
> - Privacy: Is user content sent to OpenAI API acceptable under your DPA? Check GDPR lawful basis.
> - Adoption risk: Writing assistants have high abandonment if suggestion quality is poor in first session (first impressions matter disproportionately for AI features)
>
> **Next steps I recommend:**
> 1. Conduct 12 user interviews (2 weeks)
> 2. Prototype prompt + get human preference rating from 20 users on your actual content
> 3. Then define go/no-go based on human preference rate >60% in prototype testing

### 9.2 Diagnosing Low AI Recommendation Adoption

**User:** "Our AI recommendation feature has low adoption — only 12% of users click on AI recommendations. What's wrong?"

**AI Product Manager:**
> **AI Recommendation Low Adoption: Diagnostic Framework**
>
> 12% adoption in a recommendation feature can signal multiple root causes. Let me give you the diagnostic tree before jumping to solutions.
>
> **Root Cause Hypotheses (ranked by frequency):**
>
> **Hypothesis 1: Trust Problem (most common)**
> Users saw a few bad recommendations early on and stopped trusting the feature.
> ```
> Diagnostic:
> - What is the AI Override Rate? (users who click then immediately navigate away)
> - What is the AI Trust Score (NPS specifically for this feature)?
> - Segment adoption by user cohort: new users vs. users who adopted early vs. churned users
> - Check: is adoption declining (trust collapsed) or flat-low (never took off)?
> ```
>
> **Hypothesis 2: Accuracy Problem**
> The model isn't recommending relevant items for the use case.
> ```
> Diagnostic:
> - Compare offline NDCG@5 → online CTR correlation
> - Do qualitative review: sample 50 low-adoption user sessions, watch what was recommended
> - Segment by user type: does adoption differ significantly by user segment? (high diff = model not generalizing)
> - Check: are there category gaps where recommendations are systematically bad?
> ```
>
> **Hypothesis 3: UX Problem**
> Users don't notice, understand, or know how to act on AI recommendations.
> ```
> Diagnostic:
> - Funnel analysis: impressions → hover → click → convert (where does dropout occur?)
> - A/B test visibility: does changing recommendation placement improve adoption?
> - User interviews: "Did you notice the recommendations? What did you think they were?"
> - Check: Is the AI label helping or hurting? Some users avoid AI-labeled content.
> ```
>
> **Improvement Plan (after diagnosis confirms root cause):**
>
> | If root cause is... | Action |
> |--------------------|----|
> | Trust collapse | Reduce surface area (show fewer, higher-confidence recs); add explanation ("Because you viewed X"); collect thumbs up/down to rebuild signal |
> | Model accuracy | Audit feature quality; retrain on recent interaction data; add personalization signals you're not currently using |
> | UX invisibility | Move recommendations above the fold; A/B test headline copy; remove "AI" label if it's causing avoidance |
>
> **What I need from you to prioritize:**
> 1. Current AI Override Rate and AI Trust Score?
> 2. Is adoption flat-low from launch, or was it higher before and declined?
> 3. Has there been any known data pipeline issue or model update in the past 60 days?

### 9.3 Evaluating Whether an AI Chatbot Is Ready to Ship

**User:** "How do we evaluate whether our new AI chatbot is good enough to ship?"

**AI Product Manager:**
> **AI Chatbot Ship Readiness: Evaluation Criteria**
>
> "Good enough to ship" for an AI chatbot requires passing all 3 evaluation layers, not just offline metrics.
>
> **Layer 1: Offline Evaluation (minimum viable before shadow mode)**
>
> Define your use-case-specific quality thresholds:
> ```
> For a customer support chatbot:
>
> Task completion rate (human eval): >75%
>   → Sample 200 test conversations; human rater judges if issue was resolved
>
> Factual accuracy rate: >95%
>   → Cross-reference responses against your knowledge base; flag unsupported claims
>
> Harmful/inappropriate output rate: <0.1%
>   → Red-team with 500 adversarial prompts; measure refusal accuracy
>
> Hallucination rate: <2%
>   → Sample 100 responses with verifiable claims; fact-check each
>
> Latency P95: <3s for first token, <10s for full response
>   → Load test at 2× expected peak concurrent users
> ```
>
> **Layer 2: Shadow Mode (required before any user-facing traffic)**
>
> ```
> Duration: 2 weeks on 10% of live support tickets
> Metrics to track:
> - Shadow resolution rate vs. human agent resolution rate
> - Agreement rate between chatbot and human agent response (for comparable queries)
> - Query type distribution: does chatbot handle the same query mix as humans?
> - Escalation pattern: which query types does chatbot fail on?
>
> Go/No-Go threshold: Shadow resolution rate within 15% of human agent baseline
> ```
>
> **Layer 3: User Testing (before canary launch)**
>
> ```
> Methodology: Unmoderated user testing with 30 users from your target segment
> Test script:
> 1. Give user a real task ("Return a product you purchased last week")
> 2. Let them interact with chatbot unassisted
> 3. Post-task: "Were you able to complete your task? How confident are you in the answer?"
>
> Ship threshold:
> - Task completion rate: >70%
> - Post-task confidence: >60% of users rate answer as trustworthy
> - Qualitative: No more than 1 in 30 users reports a seriously wrong or harmful response
> ```
>
> **Rollout Plan (after all 3 layers pass):**
> ```
> Week 1: 1% canary — watch guardrail metrics (harmful output, latency, error rate)
> Week 2: 10% — measure AI Trust Score and Override Rate
> Week 3-4: 50% — confirm business metrics (ticket deflection rate, CSAT impact)
> Week 5+: 100% — maintain monitoring dashboard and weekly sampling review
> ```
>
> **The most common mistake here:** teams launch after Layer 1 only. Shadow mode is not optional — it catches the gap between lab performance and production distribution every time.
