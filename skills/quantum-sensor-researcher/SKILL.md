[Code block moved to code-block-1.md]

## § 10 — Common Pitfalls

→ See [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) for code examples of:
- **Anti-Pattern 1**: Allan deviation analysis for proper sensitivity reporting
- **Anti-Pattern 2**: Heisenberg limit accounting for detection loss
- **Anti-Pattern 3**: Systematic error budget for atom interferometry
- **Anti-Pattern 4**: NV T2* vs T2 sensitivity
- **Anti-Pattern 5**: Vibration coupling in portable gravimeters

→ See [references/code-block-3.md](references/code-block-3.md) for:
- Systematic error budget Python implementation
- Vibration coupling analysis for field deployment

### Anti-Pattern 6: Quoting Optical Clock Precision Without Systematic Uncertainty

❌ BAD:
```
"Our ytterbium clock achieves 10^-18 precision."
# Statistical precision at 10^4 s averaging.
# Blackbody radiation shift uncertainty: 5 × 10^-18 (unquantified)
# Total systematic: unknown
```

✅ GOOD:
```python
# Sr optical lattice clock systematic budget (NIST-style)
systematics_clock = {
    "BBR_shift": {"value": -4.9e-15, "uncertainty": 2e-18,
                  "note": "Blackbody radiation at T = 300 K; largest systematic"},
    "Lattice_Stark": {"value": +3e-19, "uncertainty": 5e-19,
                      "note": "Magic wavelength operation suppresses; residual from intensity"},
    "Collisional": {"value": -1e-19, "uncertainty": 1e-19,
                    "note": "Density shift; suppressed by 3D lattice Mott insulator"},
    "Zeeman_2nd_order": {"value": +1e-19, "uncertainty": 5e-20,
                         "note": "Residual B-field; measured via spectroscopy on mF states"},
    "AOM_chirp": {"value": 0, "uncertainty": 1e-19,
                  "note": "Laser frequency chirp during pulse; servo-corrected"},
}

total_systematic = np.sqrt(sum(s["uncertainty"]**2 for s in systematics_clock.values()))
statistical_1e4s = 3e-18  # fractional frequency instability at 10^4 s

print(f"Statistical precision at 10^4 s: {statistical_1e4s:.0e}")
print(f"Total systematic uncertainty:    {total_systematic:.0e}")
print(f"Combined (RSS) accuracy:         {np.sqrt(statistical_1e4s**2 + total_systematic**2):.0e}")
print("\nDominant systematic: BBR shift uncertainty = 2e-18")
print("Must operate in cryogenic environment (< 100 K) to reduce BBR to < 1e-18")
```

**Why it matters**: The world's best optical clocks achieve ~10^-18 statistical precision but are limited by systematic uncertainties, primarily blackbody radiation (BBR) shift at room temperature. Precision without a complete systematic budget is not an accuracy claim.

## § 11 — Integration with Other Skills

**Quantum Sensor Researcher + Quantum Physicist**
Quantum sensors and quantum computing share overlapping hardware and techniques. The quantum physicist's pulse calibration methods (Ramsey, echo, DRAG) are identical to atom interferometer and NV-center sensing protocols. Cross-pollination: atom interferometer sequence design benefits from qubit optimal control theory; SQUID magnetometers in the sensor lab share cryogenic infrastructure with quantum processors. Concrete outcome: jointly developing a near-surface NV-center array where qubit initialization and readout fidelity analysis from the physicist team informs sensor sensitivity projections.

**Quantum Sensor Researcher + Quantum Algorithm Engineer**
Quantum sensor data (gravitational field maps, magnetic field tomography) can be processed using quantum algorithms. Grover-based search accelerates matched filtering for underground structure detection; quantum principal component analysis (qPCA) may enhance sensor array data inversion. The algorithm engineer provides honest quantum advantage assessment (classical FFT vs quantum signal processing) while the sensor researcher defines realistic data structures and measurement rates. Outcome: evidence-based decisions on where classical vs quantum data processing delivers better performance for precision sensing applications.

**Quantum Sensor Researcher + Quantum Communication Engineer**
Entanglement-enhanced sensing protocols require distributing entanglement between sensor nodes — a quantum network function. Distributed quantum sensing networks (gravitational wave detection, magnetic field imaging arrays) require the communication engineer's entanglement distribution and quantum memory expertise. Joint outcome: design of a 10-node atom interferometer network with entanglement-enhanced sensitivity, including quantum repeater links between nodes and coherence time matching between atom interferometer T2 and quantum memory storage time.

## § 12 — Scope & Limitations

**Use When:**
- Designing quantum sensing experiments (gravimetry, magnetometry, timekeeping, rotation sensing)
- Calculating sensitivity limits (SQL, Heisenberg limit, quantum Fisher information) for a sensing protocol
- Diagnosing noise floors and systematic errors in quantum sensor data
- Evaluating whether spin squeezing or entanglement provides practical sensitivity advantage
- Designing signal processing and Allan deviation analysis for precision measurement

**Do Not Use When:**
- Designing quantum computing algorithms or quantum circuits — use Quantum Algorithm Engineer skill
- Implementing QKD or quantum communication protocols — use Quantum Communication Engineer skill
- Performing qubit hardware fabrication or cryogenic chip characterization — use Quantum Physicist skill
- Seeking classical sensor design (MEMS accelerometers, fluxgate magnetometers) without quantum enhancement

**Limitations:**
- Absolute calibration of quantum sensors (SI-traceable gravity, magnetic field standards) requires institutional metrology facilities and certified procedures beyond AI-assisted design
- Biocompatibility and regulatory approval for diamond NV sensors in live biological systems requires collaboration with biosafety and regulatory experts
- Field deployment of atom interferometers involves laser safety (Class 4), cryogen handling, and vibration engineering that require certified specialists

**Test Case 1 — Gravimeter Sensitivity**
Input: "What sensitivity can I achieve with a 87Rb atom interferometer with T = 0.3 s free-fall time and 10^6 atoms?"
Expected output: Computes SQL phase sensitivity 1/√N = 0.001 rad; converts to δg = 1/(k_eff·T²·√N) ≈ 5×10^-10 g/√Hz; notes vibration and systematics as limiting factors in practice.

**Test Case 2 — SQUID Design**
Input: "I need 10 fT/√Hz SQUID magnetometer sensitivity for biomagnetic measurements. What are the requirements?"
Expected output: Computes flux noise → field sensitivity via effective area; specifies LTS SQUID parameters; requires gradiometer geometry and magnetically shielded room; gives pickup coil design constraints.

**Test Case 3 — Allan Deviation Interpretation**
Input: "My clock's Allan deviation is flat from 100 s to 10000 s. What does this indicate?"
Expected output: Diagnoses flicker (1/f) noise floor — white noise phase noise integrated to flicker; recommends identifying environmental perturbation (vibration, thermal) or laser frequency flicker; suggests correlation measurement with environmental monitors.
