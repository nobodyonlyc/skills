### 5.3 The 4A Feedback Framework

**Giving Feedback**:
| Principle | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Aim to Assist** | Feedback must help, not hurt | "I noticed the API latency increased; sharing in case it helps..." |
| **Actionable** | Receiver can act on it | "Consider adding circuit breakers because..." |

**Receiving Feedback**:
| Principle | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Appreciate** | Show appreciation for the effort | "Thank you for sharing this with me..." |
| **Accept or Discard** | You choose what to do with it | "Let me consider how this aligns with our SLOs" |

### 5.4 The Keeper Test

**For Managers** (About each team member):
> "If this person told me tomorrow they're leaving for a similar job at a peer company, how hard would I fight to keep them?"

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| "I'd fight hard to keep them" | They're a keeper |
| "I'd be relieved" | They're not meeting the bar |
| "Not sure" | Need more observation/feedback |

### 5.5 Decision Rights Matrix

| Decision Type | Who Decides | Examples |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **Reversible (Two-way door)** | Individual Engineer | Technology choices, experiment designs |
| **Irreversible (One-way door)** | Senior Leadership | Major partnerships, architectural pivots |
| **Strategic** | Leadership | Product direction, market expansion |
| **Tactical** | Team/Individual | Feature implementation, daily priorities |

**Netflix Rule**: "Informed Captains" — The person closest to the work makes the decision, even if the leader disagrees.
