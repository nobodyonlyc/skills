## Examples

### Example 1: Socratic Math Tutoring

**User:** I'm stuck on this algebra problem: 3x + 7 = 22

**Response:**

> Let's work through this together using the Socratic method! I won't give you the answer, but I'll guide you to discover it.
>
> **First, let's understand what we're solving for.** What is the goal when you see an equation like 3x + 7 = 22? What are you trying to find?
>
> *[Learner responds: "I need to find x"]*
>
> Exactly! We want to isolate x to find its value. 
>
> **Now, look at the left side: 3x + 7.** What operation is happening to x? And what's that +7 doing there?
>
> *[Learner responds: "3 is multiplied by x, and 7 is added"]*
>
> Perfect! So if we want to get x by itself, we need to undo these operations. 
>
> **Let's start with the +7.** What's the opposite of adding 7? And if we do that to the left side, what must we do to the right side?
>
> *[Learner responds and works through subtracting 7 from both sides]*
>
> Great! Now we have 3x = 15. 
>
> **What operation is happening between 3 and x now?** How can we undo that to get x completely alone?
>
> *[Learner responds: "Divide both sides by 3"]*
>
> You've got it! What do you get when you divide 15 by 3?
>
> *[Learner responds: "x = 5"]*
>
> 🎉 Excellent work! You discovered the answer yourself through critical thinking. 
>
> **Let's verify:** Does 3(5) + 7 = 22? Yes! 15 + 7 = 22 ✓
>
> You've just demonstrated the power of working backwards — a fundamental algebra skill. How does this approach feel compared to being given the answer directly?

### Example 3: Writing Coach Implementation

**User:** I'm a high school English teacher worried about students using AI to cheat on essays. How can Khan Academy's Writing Coach help?

**Response:**

> **Writing Coach: Ethical AI for Authentic Writing Growth**
>
> Your concern is exactly why Khan Academy developed Writing Coach — it ensures students do the work while receiving AI-enhanced feedback. Here's how it transforms your classroom:
>
> ## The Cheating Prevention Design
>
> Writing Coach requires students to:
> 1. **Brainstorm** within the tool (ideas captured, not generated)
> 2. **Outline** their structure (AI provides organization tips, not content)
> 3. **Draft** paragraph by paragraph (AI gives feedback on clarity, not rewrites)
> 4. **Revise** based on specific suggestions (students must implement changes)
>
> The AI **never writes for the student** — it asks questions like "How might you strengthen this claim with evidence?" or "What counterargument could you address here?"
>
> ## Teacher Dashboard Transparency
>
> You get visibility into:
> - Time spent in each writing phase
> - Revision history (every change tracked)
> - AI suggestions given vs. student actions taken
> - Originality indicators (flags if pasted content detected)
>
> ## Implementation Workflow
>
> **Week 1: Introduce the Process**
> - Explain Writing Coach as "a thoughtful editor, not a ghostwriter"
> - Show transparency dashboard to build trust
> - Set expectations: AI assists; students create
>
> **Week 2-3: Scaffolded Practice**
> - Start with short response (1 paragraph)
> - Students submit with reflection: "What feedback did you receive? How did you revise?"
>
> **Week 4+: Full Essays**
> - Assign argumentative or analytical essays
> - Require Writing Coach checkpoint at outline + draft stages
> - Grade revision effort, not just final product
>
> ## Sample Assignment Integration
>
> ```
> Literary Analysis Essay: The Great Gatsby
> 
> Requirements:
> 1. Complete brainstorm in Writing Coach (submit screenshot)
> 2. Submit outline with AI feedback incorporated
> 3. Draft in Writing Coach; address at least 5 AI suggestions
> 4. Final essay with revision reflection (200 words)
> 
> Grading Rubric:
> - Thesis clarity and originality (25%)
> - Evidence and analysis quality (25%)
> - Revision effort and growth (25%)
> - Grammar and mechanics (25%)
> ```
>
> ## Addressing Parent Concerns
>
> Share this message: *"Writing Coach teaches students to use AI ethically — as a tool for feedback and revision, not content generation. Every word in the final essay is the student's own."*
>
> ## Featured Recognition
>
> Writing Coach was featured on **60 Minutes (December 2024)** as a model for responsible AI in education.
>
> Ready to pilot this with your next essay assignment? I can help you create the specific prompt and rubric alignment.

### Example 4: Mastery Learning Pathway Design

**User:** My 7th grader is struggling with fractions and I'm not sure how to help. Can you create a mastery-based learning plan using Khan Academy?

**Response:**

> **Personalized Fractions Mastery Plan for 7th Grade**
>
> Since your student is in 7th grade but struggling with fractions, we'll use a **backfilling strategy** — mastering foundational gaps before tackling grade-level content. This follows Khan Academy's mastery learning philosophy.
>
> ## Step 1: Diagnostic Assessment
>
> Have your student take Khan Academy's **Course Challenge** in:
> - [ ] Arithmetic (to identify basic fraction gaps)
> - [ ] 5th Grade Math (foundational fractions)
> - [ ] 6th Grade Math (ratios, rates with fractions)
>
> Time: ~30 minutes per challenge
> Goal: Pinpoint exactly which fraction skills need work
>
> ## Step 2: Foundational Mastery Pathway
>
> Based on typical 7th-grade gaps, here's the recommended sequence:
>
> ### Level 1: Fraction Basics (Week 1-2)
> 1. **Understanding fractions** → Visualizing parts of a whole
> 2. **Equivalent fractions** → Finding common denominators
> 3. **Comparing fractions** → Ordering on number line
> 4. **Mixed numbers & improper fractions** → Converting between forms
>
> ### Level 2: Fraction Operations (Week 3-5)
> 5. **Adding/subtracting fractions** → Common denominators
> 6. **Adding/subtracting mixed numbers** → Regrouping
> 7. **Multiplying fractions** → Whole numbers × fractions
> 8. **Dividing fractions** → Understanding reciprocals
> 9. **Word problems** → Real-world application
>
> ### Level 3: Advanced Connections (Week 6-8)
> 10. **Fractions, decimals, percents** → Converting fluently
> 11. **Ratios with fractions** → 7th grade preview
> 12. **Proportions** → Cross-multiplication
>
> ## Step 3: Mastery Protocol
>
> For each skill, follow this progression:
> 
> ```
> 1. Watch Video → 2. Practice (5-10 problems) → 3. Get 3-5 correct in a row
>                                                        ↓
> 4. Unit Test ← 6. Spiral Review ← 5. Mastery Challenge
> ```
>
> ## Step 4: Weekly Structure
>
> | Day | Activity | Duration |
> |-----|----------|----------|
> | Mon | 2 new videos + practice | 30 min |
> | Tue | Continue practice to proficiency | 20 min |
> | Wed | Review mistakes, rewatch if needed | 20 min |
> | Thu | Mastery challenge for completed skills | 15 min |
> | Fri | Fun application (fraction cooking, games) | 30 min |
> | Weekend | Optional: Khan Academy Kids with younger sibling | 20 min |
>
> ## Step 5: Motivation System
>
> **Track Progress Visually:**
> - Print the skills list above
> - Color code: Red (not started) → Yellow (attempted) → Green (mastered)
> - Celebrate every 5 skills mastered with a reward
>
> **Khan Academy Badges:**
> - Earn "Persistence" badge for 5 days streak
> - Earn "Practice Makes Perfect" for 10 skills mastered
>
> ## Parent Support Tips
>
> 1. **Socratic questioning:** When stuck, ask "What do you think the first step is?" rather than showing how
> 2. **Concrete models:** Use pizza, chocolate bars, or measuring cups for visualization
> 3. **Growth mindset language:** "Your brain is growing!" not "You're bad at math"
> 4. **Patience with struggle:** Mastery takes time; celebrate effort over speed
>
> ## Progress Check-In Schedule
>
> - Week 2: Review diagnostic improvements
> - Week 5: Mid-point assessment
> - Week 8: Final mastery check + transition to 7th grade ratios
>
> Expected outcome: 8-10 weeks to fraction mastery, with confidence restored for grade-level work.
>
> Would you like me to create a printable tracking sheet or suggest specific Khan Academy video titles for each skill?
