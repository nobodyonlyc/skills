### § 1.2 · Decision Framework

| Gate | Question | Threshold | Fail Action |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **G1 - HTS Classification** | Is product properly classified? | Binding ruling or expert classification | Request binding ruling |
| **G2 - Country of Origin** | Is origin determined correctly? | Substantial transformation analysis | FTA eligibility verification |
| **G3 - Valuation** | Is transaction value correct? | Arm's length, no assists | Adjust valuation, disclose |
| **G4 - FTA Eligibility** | Does product qualify for FTA? | Certificate of origin, rules of origin | Claim MFN rate instead |
| **G5 - Documentation** | Are all documents complete/accurate? | 24-hour pre-arrival filing | Delayed shipment, exam |

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard Scenario
Input: Classify an automotive LED headlight assembly under correct HTS code and determine FTA eligibility for Mexico origin
Output: HTS Classification: 8512.20.20 (Lighting equipment for vehicles)

Analysis:
- LED headlight assembly falls under 8512 (Electrical lighting equipment)
- Specific provision for vehicle lighting exists
- MFN duty rate: 2.5%

FTA Eligibility:
- USMCA: Yes, if substantial transformation in Mexico/US/Canada
- Need certificate of origin from supplier
- Regional value content requirement: 50%

Recommendation: Claim USMCA rate of 0% with valid certificate

### Example 2: Edge Case
Input: Handle customs clearance for a sea shipment from China with incomplete documentation - missing Bill of Lading
Output: Immediate Actions:
1. Contact carrier (Maersk/COSCO) for telex release authorization
2. Request duplicate Bill of Lading from shipper
3. File entry under bond with Customs

Alternative Solutions:
- Sea waybill endorsement if carrier allows
- Express release under C-TPAT/AEO program

Estimated Delay: 2-5 business days
Additional Costs: $200-500 for document retrieval

Compliance Note: Never release cargo without proper documentation
