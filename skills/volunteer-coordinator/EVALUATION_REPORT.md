## 2. Issues Found

### 🔴 Critical Issues

| # | Issue | Location | Impact |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| **C1** | **Body overflow**: 637 lines exceeds 500-line limit | SKILL.md | High token cost per invocation |
| **C2** | **Missing §5 Platform Support section** | - | 0% install rate for 7 platforms |
| **C3** | **Description field bloated + repetitive** | Lines 3-7 | Exceeds 263-char budget; repeated content |
| **C4** | **Duplicate content in description** | Line 5: "Professional volunteer coordinator..." | Padding that hurts AI activation |

### 🟡 Medium Issues

| # | Issue | Location | Impact |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| **M1** | **Inconsistent section numbering** | Sections jump: §1→§2→§3→§4→§6→§7→§8→9.1→§9 | Confusing structure |
| **M2** | **Generic content in §17-§21** | Risk register, excellence framework, case studies | Not volunteer-specific; filler |
| **M3** | **Trigger word "nonprofit" too broad** | Line 497 | Causes false activation |
| **M4** | **Missing trigger verbs in description** | No actionable verbs front-loaded | Weak activation signal |

### 🟢 Minor Issues

| # | Issue | Location | Impact |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| **m1** | **YAML has 12 fields, spec requires 9** | Lines 1-22 | Over-configured |
| **m2** | **Self-score not based on rubric** | Line 520: "9.4/10" | Inflated vs. actual quality |
| **m3** | **Line 504 references missing file** | `references/standards.md` doesn't exist | Broken reference |

## 3. Dimension Scores & Rationale

### Dimension 1: System Prompt Depth (8/10)

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Role + capabilities + style | ✅ | 10+ years experience, CVA credential |
| Structured prompt with decision framework | ✅ | 4 gates defined |
| Thinking patterns | ✅ | 4 dimensions with volunteer-specific views |
| Domain-specific heuristics | ⚠️ | Could add more nuance |

**Rationale**: Strong system prompt with decision gates and thinking patterns. Missing the "heuristics" layer that would make this distinct from general project management.

---

### Dimension 2: Domain Knowledge Density (8/10)

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Deep frameworks + quantified metrics | ✅ | Volunteer cycle, recruitment funnel, metrics table |
| Real scenarios | ✅ | 2 detailed examples |
| Decision trees with specific thresholds | ⚠️ | Some metrics lack target ranges |

**Rationale**: Good framework coverage (volunteer lifecycle, retention factors, training phases). Metrics table incomplete (lines 237-241 have truncated formulas).

---

### Dimension 3: Workflow Actionability (7/10)

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 3+ phases with sub-steps | ✅ | Onboarding (4 phases), event coordination (6 steps) |
| Templates, examples, checkpoints | ⚠️ | Templates listed but not provided |
| Measurable output test | ❌ | No failure criteria defined |

**Rationale**: Workflows exist but lack "done" criteria and failure states. Templates are referenced but not concretely provided.

---

### Dimension 4: Risk Documentation (9/10)

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 5+ risks with severity | ✅ | 5 risks with 🔴/🟡 ratings |
| Domain-specific mitigation | ✅ | Concrete: background checks, written agreements |
| Escalation triggers | ⚠️ | Some triggers mentioned but not systematized |

**Rationale**: Excellent risk matrix with severity ratings. Missing escalation protocols (when to escalate, to whom).

---

### Dimension 5: Example Quality (7/10)

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 2+ full conversation flows | ⚠️ | Partial flows only (user ask → expert response, no follow-up) |
| Multi-scenario + edge cases | ⚠️ | 2 scenarios, no explicit edge cases |
| Anti-pattern correction flow | ❌ | No flow that corrects a mistake |

**Rationale**: Two good scenario examples but they are single-turn responses, not multi-turn conversation flows. No explicit anti-pattern correction example.

---

### Dimension 6: Metadata Completeness (7/10)

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| All 9 required fields | ⚠️ | 12 fields present (over-configured) |
| Description has role + triggers + works-with | ❌ | No "Works with" statement |
| Description ≤263 chars + trigger verbs front-loaded | ❌ | ~350 chars, repeated content, no verbs front-loaded |

**Rationale**: Description violates token budget and lacks "Works with" statement. Version history not present in skill.

## 4. Concrete Fix Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Fixes (Fix First → Highest ROI)

| Fix | Action | Lines Saved | ROI |
|-----|--------|-------------|-----|
| **F1**: Trim description to ≤263 chars | Rewrite with front-loaded trigger verbs | +20 chars | +1.0 metadata score |
| **F2**: Add Platform Support (§5) | Add install matrix for all 7 platforms | +15 lines | +2.0 overall |
| **F3**: Offload sections >3 lines to references/ | Move §17-§21 to references/volunteer-frameworks.md | ~80 lines | +0.5 workflow score |
| **F4**: Fix section numbering | Standardize to H2: ## §1, ## §2, etc. | 0 | Improves structure |

### Priority 2: Content Improvements

| Fix | Action | Expected Gain |
|-----|--------|----------------|
| **F5**: Add 2 more scenario flows with multi-turn | Include retention-diagnosis follow-up, volunteer-misconduct handling | +1.5 examples score |
| **F6**: Add "done" criteria to workflows | Add [✓ Done] checkpoints and ✗ FAIL blocks | +0.5 workflow score |
| **F7**: Fix metric table formulas | Complete the truncated formulas in §7.2 | +0.5 domain score |
| **F8**: Add escalation protocols to risk matrix | Specify when/how to escalate for each high-severity risk | +0.5 risk score |

### Priority 3: Polish

| Fix | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **F9**: Remove duplicate "Professional volunteer coordinator" from description |
| **F10**: Add "Works with" clause to description |
| **F11**: Cull trigger words to 4-6 specific phrases (remove "nonprofit") |
