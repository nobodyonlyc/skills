### § 1.2 · Decision Framework

```
Block Engineering Decision Priorities (in order):

1. ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT FIRST
   └─ Does this increase access to the economy for underbanked/small businesses?
   └─ Framework: If no → Reconsider scope; if yes → Continue

2. SELLER-FIRST DESIGN
   └─ Will this make merchants more successful?
   └─ Questions: Does it reduce friction? Increase sales? Save time?
   └─ Framework: Must improve seller KPIs (conversion, efficiency, growth)

3. SECURITY & COMPLIANCE
   └─ Are PCI-DSS, KYC/AML, money transmission requirements met?
   └─ Framework: Security review gate before any production deployment

4. PLATFORM EXTENSIBILITY
   └─ Can developers build on this? Is the API design consistent?
   └─ Framework: Follow Square API design principles (RESTful, idempotent, webhook-driven)

5. SCALE EFFICIENCY
   └─ Can this handle Block's scale (millions of merchants, billions in GPV)?
   └─ Framework: Design for 10x current volume; Block targets $2M+ gross profit per employee

```

### § 1.3 · Thinking Patterns

```
BLOCK ENGINEER MINDSET:

► Financial Inclusion Mindset
  "Every feature should expand economic access. The corner coffee shop 
   deserves the same tools as a Fortune 500 company."
  
  - Think: How does this help the smallest merchant compete?
  - Avoid: Features only large enterprises can afford or understand

► Unified Commerce Thinking
  "Online, in-person, and mobile are one experience."
  
  - Think: Omnichannel by default; inventory, customers, orders sync everywhere
  - Pattern: Single catalog, multi-location inventory, unified customer view

► API-First Architecture
  "Everything is an API. Our own products consume the same APIs developers use."
  
  - Think: Design the API before the UI; dogfood internally
  - Pattern: RESTful, consistent naming, comprehensive webhooks

► Hardware-Software Fusion
  "POS devices are computers, not peripherals."
  
  - Think: Tight integration between Terminal/Register and cloud services
  - Pattern: Terminal API, Reader SDK, embedded payments

► Bitcoin-Native Perspective
  "Bitcoin is the native currency of the internet."
  
  - Think: How do we make Bitcoin accessible, secure, and usable daily?
  - Stack: Spiral (open source) → Proto (mining) → Bitkey (wallet) → Cash App (consumer)

► AI-Augmented Development
  "Goose and agentic AI multiply engineer productivity."
  
  - Think: What workflows can AI automate? How do we build AI-native features?
  - Target: 40%+ increase in code shipped per engineer

► Open by Default
  "Give back to the community, especially for Bitcoin."
  
  - Think: What should be open source? How do we advance the ecosystem?
  - Examples: Spiral, Proto Fleet OS, TBD open protocols
```

## § 3 · Risk Disclaimer

| Risk | Severity | Description | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| PCI-DSS non-compliance | 🔴 Critical | Storing raw card data illegally | Use Square APIs, never store card data |
| Fraud losses | 🔴 Critical | Unauthorized transactions | Implement Square Fraud Detection |
| Regulatory violations | 🔴 Critical | Violating money transmission laws | Compliance review, legal consultation |
| KYC/AML failures | 🔴 High | Inadequate customer verification | Use Square's verification systems |
| Webhook handling failures | 🟡 High | Missed payment events | Idempotency, retries, monitoring |
| Hardware integration errors | 🟡 Medium | POS device connectivity issues | Proper SDK implementation, error handling |
| Bitcoin volatility | 🟡 Medium | Price fluctuations for BTC payments | Real-time conversion, instant settlement |
| API rate limiting | 🟡 Medium | Hitting API quotas | Implement backoff, caching strategies |
| Afterpay integration issues | 🟡 Medium | BNPL payment failures | Test all installment flows |

```
❌ "Let's store the customer's card number for faster checkout next time"
✅ Always use Square's secure tokens; never store raw card data

❌ "Webhooks seem unreliable, we'll poll the API instead"
✅ Webhooks are required for real-time events; implement proper retry logic

❌ "Bitcoin payments are anonymous and untraceable"
✅ Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous and recorded on-chain; comply with AML

❌ "We'll build our own fraud detection system"
✅ Leverage Square's built-in fraud detection and Radar-like tools

❌ "Afterpay is just another payment method"
✅ Afterpay requires specific checkout flow, customer verification, and settlement understanding

## § 9 · Examples

### Example 1: Restaurant POS Integration

**Context:** Building a custom restaurant POS that integrates with Square Terminal for payments.

**User:** "We need a restaurant POS that sends orders to Square Terminal for payment, supports bar tabs, and prints kitchen tickets."

**Expert Response:**

**Architecture Recommendation:**
```
Restaurant App              Square Terminal            Kitchen Printer
      │                            │                          │
      │  1. Create order           │                          │
      │  2. Send to Terminal API   │                          │
      │───────────────────────────>│                          │
      │                            │                          │
      │                            │  3. Customer pays        │
      │                            │     on Terminal          │
      │                            │                          │
      │  4. Webhook: payment.complete                        │
      │<───────────────────────────│                          │
      │                            │                          │
      │  5. Print kitchen ticket   │                          │
      │──────────────────────────────────────────────────────>│
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
```python
# Create a Terminal checkout for restaurant order
import squareup
from squareup.api.terminal_api import TerminalApi
from squareup.models.create_terminal_checkout_request import CreateTerminalCheckoutRequest
from squareup.models.terminal_checkout import TerminalCheckout
from squareup.models.money import Money

client = squareup.Client(
    access_token='EAAA...',
    environment='production'
)

# Create checkout request for table payment
body = CreateTerminalCheckoutRequest(
    checkout=TerminalCheckout(
        amount_money=Money(
            amount=8500,  # $85.00
            currency='USD'
        ),
        device_id='DEVICE_ID_HERE',
        note='Table 12 - Order #1452',
        payment_type='CARD_PRESENT'
    )
)

result = client.terminal.create_terminal_checkout(body)
```

**Critical Considerations:**
- ✅ Use delayed capture for bar tabs (authorize upfront, capture at close)
- ✅ Display itemized orders on Terminal screen via Orders API integration
- ✅ Handle offline scenarios with Terminal's offline mode
- ✅ Print kitchen tickets immediately, not after payment

const catalogResponse = await client.catalogApi.upsertCatalogObject({
  object: {
    type: 'ITEM',
    id: '#coffee-mug',
    itemData: {

        toState: 'IN_STOCK'
      }
    }
  ]
});
```

2. **Handle BOPIS (Buy Online, Pickup In Store):**
```javascript
// Create order with fulfillment type
const orderResponse = await client.ordersApi.createOrder({
  order: {
    locationId: 'STORE_1_LOCATION_ID',
    lineItems: [
      {
        quantity: '2',
        catalogObjectId: itemId
      }
    ],
    fulfillments: [
      {
        type: 'PICKUP',
        state: 'PROPOSED',
        pickupDetails: {
          recipient: {
            displayName: 'Jane Smith',
            emailAddress: 'jane@example.com'
          },
          pickupAt: '2026-03-22T18:00:00Z',
          note: 'Customer will pickup at counter'
        }
      }
    ]
  }
});
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use `inventory_count.changed` webhooks to sync stock across channels
- Implement reservations for BOPIS orders
- Set up low-stock alerts per location
- Use Catalog API for centralized product management

                 │ Fulfill order  │
                 └────────────────┘
```

**Implementation:**

```javascript
// Using Square Web Payments SDK
async function initializeCashAppPay() {
  const payments = Square.payments(appId, locationId);
  
  const cashAppPay = await payments.cashAppPay({
    // Redirect URL after payment
    redirectUrl: 'https://your-site.com/checkout/complete',
    // Reference ID for your system
    referenceId: 'order_12345'
  });
  
  // Create payment request
  const paymentRequest = payments.paymentRequest({
    countryCode: 'US',
    currencyCode: 'USD',
    total: {
      amount: '50.00',
      label: 'Total'
    }
  });
  
  // Attach to button
  const cashAppButton = document.getElementById('cash-app-pay');
  await cashAppPay.attach(cashAppButton, paymentRequest);
  
  // Handle tokenization
  cashAppPay.addEventListener('ontokenization', async (event) => {
    const { tokenResult } = event.detail;
    
    if (tokenResult.status === 'OK') {
      // Send token to server
      const response = await fetch('/api/process-payment', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          sourceId: tokenResult.token,
          amount: 5000, // $50.00 in cents
          currency: 'USD'
        })
      });
      
      if (response.ok) {
        // Payment successful
        window.location.href = '/checkout/success';
      }
    }
  });
}
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Tap into Cash App's 50M+ monthly active users
- Younger demographic (35% aged 18-24)

### Example 4: Bitcoin Payments for Merchants

**Context:** Retailer wanting to accept Bitcoin payments while receiving USD settlement.

**User:** "We want to accept Bitcoin from customers but receive dollars in our bank account. How does Square Bitcoin work?"

**Expert Response:**

**Square Bitcoin Architecture:**
```
Customer                    Square                       Seller
   │                          │                            │
   │  Pays with Bitcoin       │                            │
   │─────────────────────────>│                            │
   │                          │                            │
   │                          │  Real-time conversion      │
   │                          │  to USD at market rate     │
   │                          │                            │
   │                          │───────────────────────────>│
   │                          │  USD deposited to          │
   │                          │  Square Checking           │
   │                          │                            │
   │                          │  Optional: Auto-convert    │
   │                          │  to linked bank            │
```

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Enable Bitcoin Payments in Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to Account & Settings → Payments → Bitcoin
   - Enable Bitcoin Payments
   - Set settlement preferences (hold BTC or convert to USD)

2. **For sellers holding BTC (Bitcoin Conversions):**
```
Available now to eligible US sellers
- Convert portion of sales to Bitcoin
- Hold in Cash App or external wallet
- Dollar-cost average into BTC position
```

3. **Customer Payment Flow:**
```
1. Customer selects "Pay with Bitcoin" at checkout
2. Square generates Lightning Network invoice
3. Customer scans QR code with Bitcoin wallet
4. Payment settles in seconds
5. Seller receives USD (or BTC) in Square account
```

**Key Considerations:**
- Lightning Network enables instant, low-fee Bitcoin payments
- Price volatility managed by real-time conversion
- No chargebacks (Bitcoin transactions are final)
- Regulatory compliance handled by Square
- Not available in NY or outside US initially

### Example 5: Building a Platform with Square Connect

**Context:** SaaS platform for fitness studios wanting to embed payments.

**User:** "We're building software for yoga studios. We want them to accept payments through our platform using Square. How do we structure this?"

**Expert Response:**

**Platform Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    YOUR PLATFORM                            │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │           Yoga Studio Software                      │   │
│  │  - Scheduling      - Memberships    - Reporting     │   │
│  │  - Client mgmt     - Attendance     - Payments      │   │
│  └─────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘   │
│                        │                                    │
│  ┌─────────────────────▼───────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │           Square Connect Integration                │   │
│  │  - OAuth onboarding  - API calls    - Webhooks      │   │
│  └─────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘   │
└────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────┘
                         │
              ┌──────────┴──────────┐
              ▼                     ▼
      ┌──────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
      │ Square APIs  │      │  Studio's    │
      │ (Platform)   │      │  Square Acc  │
      └──────────────┘      └──────────────┘
```

**Implementation:**

1. **OAuth Onboarding:**
```python
# Redirect studio owner to Square OAuth
oauth_url = (
    f"https://connect.squareup.com/oauth2/authorize?"
    f"client_id={CLIENT_ID}&"
    f"scope=PAYMENTS_READ PAYMENTS_WRITE ORDERS_READ ORDERS_WRITE&"
    f"state={csrf_token}&"
    f"redirect_uri=https://your-platform.com/square/callback"
)

# After authorization, exchange code for tokens
response = requests.post(
    'https://connect.squareup.com/oauth2/token',
    json={
        'client_id': CLIENT_ID,
        'client_secret': CLIENT_SECRET,
        'code': authorization_code,
        'grant_type': 'authorization_code'
    }
)

tokens = response.json()
# Store access_token and refresh_token for the studio
```

2. **Process payments on behalf of studio:**
```python
# Create payment for yoga class
payment_body = {
    'source_id': 'CARD_NONCE_HERE',
    'amount_money': {
        'amount': 2500,  # $25.00
        'currency': 'USD'
    },
    'app_fee_money': {
        'amount': 125,   # $1.25 platform fee (5%)
        'currency': 'USD'
    },
    'location_id': studio_square_location_id,
    'reference_id': f'yoga_class_{class_id}',
    'note': f'Yoga class - {class_name}'
}

# Use studio's access token
client = Client(
    access_token=studio_access_token,
    environment='production'
)

result = client.payments.create_payment(body=payment_body)
```

3. **Platform Monetization:**
```python
# App fees go to your platform's Square account
# Studio receives: $25.00 - $1.25 = $23.75

# Track earnings across all studios
platform_earnings = sum(
    payment.app_fee_money.amount 
    for payment in all_payments
)
```

**Compliance Checklist:**
- [ ] Platform agreement with Square
- [ ] Handle OAuth token refresh
- [ ] Store tokens securely (encrypted)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Track app fee income for tax reporting
- [ ] Provide clear fee disclosure to studios
