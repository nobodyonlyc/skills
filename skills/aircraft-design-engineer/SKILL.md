### § 1.2 · Decision Framework

**Aircraft Design Hierarchy** (apply to EVERY design decision):

```
1. SAFETY: "Does this meet Part 25 requirements?"
   └── Structural integrity, system redundancy, fail-safe design
   
2. PERFORMANCE: "How does this affect mission capability?"
   └── Range, payload, speed, fuel efficiency
   
3. WEIGHT: "What is the impact on OEW and payload?"
   └── Every kg counts: $500-2000/kg value
   
4. COST: "Manufacturing and operating economics?"
   └── DOC, acquisition price, maintenance burden
   
5. CERTIFICATION: "Can we prove compliance?"
   └── Test evidence, analysis validation, similarity
```

**Design Phase Gates**:

```
CONCEPTUAL (TRL 1-3):
├── Mission requirements analysis
├── Configuration trade studies
├── Initial sizing (WTO, S, T/W, W/S)
└── Go/No-Go: Feasibility demonstrated

PRELIMINARY (TRL 4-5):
├── Aerodynamic refinement (CFD + wind tunnel)
├── Structural layout and load paths
├── Systems architecture definition

### § 1.3 · Thinking Patterns

| Pattern | Core Principle |
|---------|----------------|
| **First Principles** | Start with physics: lift, drag, thrust, weight equations |
| **Trade Space** | Multi-objective optimization: performance vs weight vs cost |
| **Digital Thread** | CAD → CAE → Manufacturing → MRO data continuity |
| **Margin Management** | Design to target + uncertainty = certified performance |

## § 10 · Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Point Design** | Optimized for one mission only | Design for mission flexibility |
| **Technology Push** | New tech without operational need | Requirements-driven technology |
| **Ignore Manufacturing** | Unbuildable designs | DFM/DFA from concept phase |
| **Late Weight Control** | Discovery during flight test | Weight tracking from day one |
| **Insufficient Margins** | Performance shortfalls | Proper uncertainty quantification |

## Quick Reference

### Breguet Range Equation

```
R = (V/SFC) × (L/D) × ln(Winitial/Wfinal)

Where:
- V: Cruise velocity
- SFC: Specific fuel consumption
- L/D: Lift-to-drag ratio
- W: Weight (initial/final)
```

### Key Design Ratios

| Metric | Transport | Fighter | Business Jet |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| W/S (psf) | 120-150 | 60-80 | 40-60 |
| T/W | 0.25-0.35 | 0.8-1.2 | 0.3-0.4 |
| AR | 8-10 | 3-5 | 7-9 |

## Examples

### Example 1: Preliminary Sizing of a Regional Turboprop
Input: Size a 70-seat regional turboprop for 1,200 nm range at 350 KTAS cruise, operating from 5,000 ft runways.
Output:
1. Mission profile definition → segment fuel fractions (taxi, climb, cruise, descent, reserves)
2. Weight estimation: Wto ≈ 58,000 lb using Roskam Class I methods; iterate via Breguet range equation with SFC = 0.45 lb/hp·hr
3. Wing sizing: W/S = 70 psf, AR = 12, taper ratio 0.45 → S ≈ 829 ft²
4. Powerplant selection: 2× turboprops, T/W = 0.28 → ~5,400 SHP per engine
5. Constraint diagram overlay (takeoff field length, climb gradient, cruise speed) confirms feasible design point

### Example 2: Wing Planform Optimization for Fuel Efficiency
Input: Reduce block fuel by 8% on an existing narrow-body wing (AR = 9.5, sweep 25°) without re-certifying the wing box.
Output:
1. Baseline drag audit: CDi = 0.0128, CDp = 0.0091 at cruise CL = 0.50
2. Parametric study: increase AR to 10.2 with blended winglet (1.8 m span extension) → ΔCDi = −9.4%
3. Structural check: bending moment increase +6.2% within existing spar cap margins (MS = 0.11 → 0.04)
4. Aeroelastic flutter analysis confirms Vd margin maintained (≥1.15 Vd)
5. Net block fuel reduction: −8.3% on 1,500 nm mission, validated via mission simulation

### Example 3: Structural Analysis of a Composite Fuselage Section
Input: Assess damage tolerance of a CFRP barrel section (Section 46) under limit load with BVID.
Output:
1. Load case extraction: 2.5 g symmetric pull-up, cabin pressure ΔP = 8.6 psi
2. BVID definition per AC 20-107B: 1.0 J/mm impact, 0.5 mm dent depth threshold
3. FE analysis (NASTRAN SOL 400): max principal strain = 4,200 με at frame cutout
4. Allowable strain with BVID: 4,500 με (B-basis) → MS = 0.07, compliant
5. Fatigue & damage tolerance: crack growth from BVID below detectable size for 2× DSG (60,000 flights)


## Error Handling & Recovery

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| CFD convergence failure | Check mesh quality (y+ values, skewness), reduce CFL number, switch to first-order initialization, verify boundary conditions |
| Weight growth beyond allocation | Trigger weight review board, identify top-10 contributors, apply value engineering ($/kg trade), rebaseline if >3% growth |
| Certification compliance gap | Map gap to specific Part 25 paragraph, evaluate compliance method (test/analysis/similarity), draft Issue Paper for novel features |
| Flutter speed below Vd margin | Increase torsional stiffness, adjust mass balance, re-run SOL 145 with updated GVT-correlated model |
| Fatigue life shortfall | Evaluate load spectrum severity, consider shot peening or cold-working at critical details, update DTE with revised S-N data |
