### Phase 2: Flux Pinning Enhancement Research (Months 1–6)

**BZO Nanorod Pinning in REBCO — Defect Design:**
```python
def bzo_pinning_optimization(BZO_density_per_m2, BZO_diameter_nm, T_K, B_T):
    """
    Estimate Jc enhancement from BZO nanorod columnar defects in REBCO.
    BZO (BaZrO3) nanorods: typical diameter 5-10 nm, density 5×10^15 to 10^16 /m²
    Matching field: B_phi = phi0 * nL (where nL = number density × length)
    phi0 = 2.07×10^-15 T·m² (flux quantum)
    """
    phi0 = 2.07e-15  # T·m²

    # Matching field: B* at which vortex density = columnar defect density
    B_match = phi0 * BZO_density_per_m2
    print(f"BZO matching field B* = {B_match:.1f} T")

    # Jc enhancement: maximum near B* (all defects occupied by vortices)
    # Below B*: Jc scales as (B/B*)^alpha (alpha ~ 0.5 for columnar defects)
    # Above B*: excess vortices form interstitial vortices → Jc drops
    if B_T <= B_match:
        enhancement = 1.0 + 0.8 * (B_T
    else:
        enhancement = 1.0 + 0.8 * (B_match

    print(f"At {B_T}T: Jc enhancement factor ≈ {enhancement:.2f}")
    return enhancement, B_match

# Example: BZO density = 8×10^15 /m² (typical SuperPower or Fujikura HTS tape)
enh, Bstar = bzo_pinning_optimization(8e15, BZO_diameter_nm=8, T_K=4.2, B_T=12)
# B* ≈ 16.5 T — defects occupied up to 16.5T → excellent for fusion (12T operating point)
```

**Bean Model for Jc from Magnetization Measurement:**
```python
def bean_model_Jc(delta_M, sample_a_mm, sample_b_mm):
    """
    Extended Bean model for rectangular sample:
    Jc = 20 * ΔM / [a * (1 - a/(3b))]
    ΔM: full magnetization loop width (emu/cm³ = MA/m × 10^-3) at given field
    a, b: sample half-widths (mm), a ≤ b (a = shorter dimension)
    Returns: Jc in A/cm²
    """
    a = sample_a_mm
    b = sample_b_mm
    Jc_A_cm2 = 20 * delta_M / (a * (1 - a
    Jc_A_mm2 = Jc_A_cm2
    return Jc_A_mm2

# Example: REBCO tape section (4mm × 10mm), ΔM = 0.042 T/μ0 = 33,400 A/m = 33.4 kA/m
# In CGS: ΔM_emu_cm3 = 33400 * 1e-3 = 33.4 emu/cm³ (at B = 12T, T = 4.2K)
# Sample: 4mm × 10mm → a = 2mm, b = 5mm
Jc = bean_model_Jc(delta_M=33.4, sample_a_mm=2.0, sample_b_mm=5.0)
print(f"Jc from Bean model: {Jc:.0f} A/mm²")
# → Jc ≈ 1450 A/mm² (reasonable for REBCO at 12T, 4.2K, B‖c)
```

✗ Do not spec "Jc at 77K self-field" for fusion applications (operating at 4.2 K, 12–16 T)

## 🔬 Scenario Examples

### 🚫 Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Reporting Jc at 77K Self-Field for Fusion/High-Field Applications
**Wrong:** "Our REBCO tape has Jc = 5 MA/cm² — excellent for fusion magnets."
**Why it fails:** 77K self-field Jc (~5 MA/cm²) is a standard quality metric but is irrelevant for fusion at 4.2–20 K and 12–16 T. At 12T/4.2K B‖c, typical Jc drops to 1.5–2 MA/cm². The ratio can be 3–10×.
**Correct:** Always report Jc at operating (B, T, θ): "Jc = 1.8 MA/cm² at 12T, 4.2K, B‖c for fusion TF coil application."

### Anti-Pattern 2: Ignoring Field Angle Anisotropy in REBCO
**Wrong:** Use Jc(B‖ab) data for coil load-line analysis when coil field is predominantly B‖c.
**Why it fails:** REBCO has 3–10× Jc anisotropy. Using B‖ab data (favorable orientation) for a coil where B‖c (worst case) at peak field overestimates current margin by 3–10×. Magnet quenches below design current.
**Correct:** Measure full Jc(B,T,θ) surface. For magnet design: use Jc averaged over field orientation distribution OR use minimum Jc (B‖c) for safety.

### Anti-Pattern 3: React-and-Wind vs. Wind-and-React Confusion for Nb3Sn
**Wrong:** Wind coil from pre-reacted Nb3Sn strand into tight radius (< 20 mm) coil.
**Why it fails:** After reaction, Nb3Sn is brittle (A15 phase, fracture strain < 0.3%). Winding imposes bending strain εb = wire_diameter / (2 × bend_radius). At r = 10mm, εb = 0.4mm
**Correct:** Use wind-and-react for tight coils: wind with unreacted wire (ductile), then react in furnace (635–650°C, 100–200 hours). Or use react-and-wind only for large-radius coils (r > 50 mm diameter/2).

### Anti-Pattern 4: Quench Protection Design Overlooking Adiabatic Hot Spot Temperature
**Wrong:** Design quench dump resistor based on stored energy/resistance, ignoring local hot spot temperature rise.
**Why it fails:** During quench, normal zone propagates at ~1–20 m/s. Before propagation covers the full coil, the initial quench zone absorbs all energy → T_hotspot can reach 300–500 K even if average T is safe. At T > 200 K, REBCO tape loses superconductivity permanently (Jc degradation by annealing effects at elevated temperature).
**Correct:** Calculate MIITS (MA²s integral) in hot spot: MIITS = ∫I²dt. T_hotspot from copper heat capacity integral. Use MIITs limit ≤ 15 MA²·ms for REBCO tape (corresponds to T_hotspot ≤ 200 K). Design active quench protection to stay within limit.

### Anti-Pattern 5: Using SQUID Magnetometry Without Demagnetization Factor Correction
**Wrong:** Apply Bean model Jc formula for thin films/tapes using bulk formula without geometry correction.
**Why it fails:** For thin tape (thickness << width), demagnetization factor N → 1. Bean model for cylinder assumes N = 0. Uncorrected Jc can be underestimated by factor of 2–3 for tape geometry.
**Correct:** Use extended Bean model for rectangular cross-section: Jc = 20ΔM / [a(1 - a/3b)] where a ≤ b are half-widths. Or use Brandt-Indenbom model for thin strips. Always state sample geometry when reporting Jc.
