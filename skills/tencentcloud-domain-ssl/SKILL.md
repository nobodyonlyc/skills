| Resource shortage | Budget/time exceeded | Replan with constraints |
| Scope creep | Requirements expand | Reassess and negotiate |
| Safety incident | Risk threshold exceeded | Stop, mitigate, restart |

### Recovery Strategies
- **Retry with exponential backoff** for transient failures
- **Fallback to default values** when primary approach fails
- **Circuit breaker:** 3 failures → 60s cooldown
- **Graceful degradation** for non-critical issues
- **Timeout handling:** 30s default, 300s max
