### § 1.2 · Decision Framework

**The CV Architecture Decision Hierarchy**:

```
1. TASK COMPLEXITY & ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS
   └── Simple classification → EfficientNet, MobileNet
   └── Object detection → YOLO for speed, DETR for accuracy
   └── Instance segmentation → Mask2Former, SAM
   └── Keypoint detection → HigherHRNet, MMPose
   └── OCR → PaddleOCR, TrOCR

2. INFERENCE SPEED CONSTRAINTS
   └── Real-time 30+ FPS → YOLOv8-nano, MobileNet
   └── Fast 10-30 FPS → YOLOv8-small, EfficientNet-B0
   └── Accuracy critical → YOLOv8-xlarge, DETR
   └── Batch processing → Largest model that fits GPU

3. DEPLOYMENT TARGET
   └── Edge (Raspberry Pi, Jetson) → Quantized, pruned
   └── Mobile (iOS, Android) → Core ML, TFLite
   └── Server GPU → TensorRT, ONNX Runtime
   └── Browser → ONNX.js, TensorFlow.js

4. DATA CHARACTERISTICS
   └── Small dataset (< 1000) → Transfer learning
   └── Domain gap → Domain adaptation, synthetic data
   └── Class imbalance → Focal loss, oversampling
   └── Annotation quality → Active learning, cleaning

5. PREPROCESSING & POSTPROCESSING
   └── Image normalization for model
   └── Data augmentation strategy
   └── NMS parameters for detection
   └── Temporal filtering for video
```

**Quality Gates**:

| Gate | Question | Fail Action |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Data | Representative training data? | Collect more diverse data |
| Accuracy | mAP/IoU meets requirements? | Iterate model or data |
| Speed | Inference time within budget? | Optimize or use smaller model |
| Robustness | Works in real conditions? | Test on target environment |
| Bias | Fair across demographics? | Bias evaluation, balanced data |

### § 1.3 · Thinking Patterns

**Pattern 1: Data-Centric Development**

```
Data quality matters more than model complexity.

Focus:
├── Label accuracy over quantity
├── Class balance in training set
├── Hard negative mining
├── Domain representation (lighting, angles, occlusions)
└── Active learning for efficient annotation
```

**Pattern 2: Progressive Model Scaling**

```
Start small, scale based on requirements.

Progression:
├── Baseline: Pre-trained model, no fine-tuning
├── Quick: Light fine-tuning (frozen backbone)
├── Standard: Full fine-tuning with augmentation
├── Advanced: Architecture search, ensemble
└── Optimize: Knowledge distillation, quantization
```

**Pattern 3: Multi-Scale Processing**

```
Objects come in all sizes. Handle them all.

Techniques:
├── FPN (Feature Pyramid Network) for multi-scale
├── Test-time augmentation (TTA) for robustness
├── Multi-resolution training
├── Anchor-free detectors (FCOS, CenterNet)
└── NMS with soft voting
```

**Pattern 4: Deployment Optimization**

```
Training is research; inference is engineering.

Optimization:
├── Quantization: FP32 → INT8 (4× speedup)
├── Pruning: Remove redundant weights
├── Knowledge distillation: Student learns from teacher
├── TensorRT: Layer fusion, kernel optimization
└── Batch inference: Amortize overhead
```

**Pattern 5: Temporal Consistency**

```
Video has temporal structure. Exploit it.

Methods:
├── Object tracking (SORT, DeepSORT, ByteTrack)
├── Temporal smoothing of predictions
├── Multi-frame fusion
├── Motion prediction for occlusions
└── Online learning for appearance models
```
