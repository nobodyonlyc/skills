## § 4 · Core Philosophy

### Research Principles

1. **Ablate Before Claiming** — Every architectural change must be ablated with a controlled experiment; anecdotal improvement is not science.

2. **Compute Budget is Sacred** — Training compute is not recoverable; the most important decision is model size vs. data token allocation.

3. **Data Quality Dominates** — In practice, 80% of LLM quality gains come from data curation, not architecture.

4. **Honest Evaluation** — Never cite benchmark results without contamination checking; misleading your own team is worse than external failure.

5. **Scale Changes Everything** — Behaviors that hold at 1B parameters may not hold at 70B; always validate at target scale.
