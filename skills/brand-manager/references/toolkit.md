## Phase 1: Brand Audit & Opportunity Assessment (Weeks 1–3)

```
Brand Audit Checklist:
□ Internal:
  - Review brand guidelines (exist? Current? Enforced?)
  - Stakeholder interviews: "What does our brand stand for? What do you wish it stood for?"
  - Creative asset audit: consistent use of logo, color, font, photography style?
  - Message audit: website, sales decks, ads — do they tell the same story?

□ External:
  - Consumer research: unaided awareness (%), aided awareness (%), brand consideration (%)
  - NPS score and key drivers (promoters vs. detractors themes)
  - Perceptual map vs. top 5 competitors
  - SOV tracking: brand mentions vs. category vs. top 3 competitors

□ Competitive:
  - Share of Search (Google Trends proxy for relative brand awareness)
  - Advertising spend estimate (Kantar
  - Brand tone analysis: formal/informal, premium/accessible, emotional/rational

Output: Brand Audit Report (30-page max) with:
  - Current brand health scorecard
  - Key gaps (positioning clarity, visual consistency, message alignment)
  - 3 strategic options with recommendation
```

### Phase 2: Strategy Development & Creative Briefing (Weeks 4–8)

**Creative Brief Template:**
```
PROJECT: [Campaign name and objective]
DEADLINE: [Final delivery date; milestones]

1. BACKGROUND: Why are we doing this? What context does the creative team need? [✓] Done when: | [✗] FAIL if:

2. OBJECTIVE: One clear, measurable goal [✓] Done when: | [✗] FAIL if:
   Example: "Increase brand consideration among 25-40 urban professionals by 5pp in Q3"

3. TARGET AUDIENCE: [✓] Done when: | [✗] FAIL if:
   Primary: [Specific demographic + psychographic profile]
   Secondary: [If applicable]
   Insight: "[Quote or verbatim that captures the tension we're resolving]"

4. SINGLE-MINDED MESSAGE: One sentence the audience should walk away believing. [✓] Done when: | [✗] FAIL if:
   (If you can't say it in one sentence, it's not single-minded enough)

5. SUPPORT [✓] Done when: | [✗] FAIL if:

6. TONE & MANNER: [3 adjectives that describe how it should feel; 3 that it must NOT feel] [✓] Done when: | [✗] FAIL if:

7. MANDATORY ELEMENTS: Legal disclaimers, brand lockups, call-to-action requirements [✓] Done when: | [✗] FAIL if:

8. WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE: Specific metric, measurement method, timeline [✓] Done when: | [✗] FAIL if:
   Example: "5pp lift in aided recall vs. pre-campaign baseline in brand tracker"

9. WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING: Scope constraints; what's explicitly out of bounds [✓] Done when: | [✗] FAIL if:
```

✓ Brief approved by CMO and brand director before creative development begins
✓ Legal and compliance review completed for all claims
✗ Never brief without a single-minded message — "and also" briefs produce mediocre creative

### Phase 3: Launch, Tracking & Optimization (Weeks 9–ongoing)

        'unaided_awareness_pct': None,   # % who name brand unprompted in category

    weights = {'awareness': 0.25, 'consideration': 0.25, 'preference': 0.20,
               'nps_normalized': 0.20, 'sov': 0.10}
    # Normalize each metric to 0-100 scale relative to category benchmark

    pass
```

✓ Monthly brand tracker data reviewed vs. baseline and competitors
✓ Campaign post-mortems completed within 4 weeks of campaign end
✓ NPS driver analysis reviewed quarterly with product team
✗ Never attribute brand metric changes to single campaign without control group or timing analysis

## 🔬 Scenario Examples

### 🚫 Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Brand by Committee
**Wrong:** Brand guidelines created by cross-functional task force of 15 people; every stakeholder has veto power.
**Why it fails:** Consensus kills distinctiveness. Each stakeholder moderates toward the inoffensive middle. The resulting brand stands for nothing and competes with nothing.
**Correct:** Brand strategy owned by 1-2 people (Brand Director + CMO). Consult broadly, decide narrowly. Test with target consumers, not internal committees.

### Anti-Pattern 2: Confusing Brand with Product Marketing
**Wrong:** Brand campaign leads with product features: "Now with 25% more storage and 3x faster sync."
**Why it fails:** Feature campaigns build product trial but don't build brand equity (emotional associations, trust). After 3 years, brand is perceived as commodity.
**Correct:** Brand campaigns build the emotional and associative layer ("Why we exist, what we believe"). Product campaigns convert ("Why buy now"). Both needed; both different creative and KPIs.

### Anti-Pattern 3: Measuring Brand Only at Campaign End
**Wrong:** Run 3-month brand campaign; measure aided awareness at campaign end; declare success.
**Why it fails:** No pre-campaign baseline; no ability to attribute lift; no learnings for optimization.
**Correct:** Establish baseline brand tracker BEFORE campaign. Run mid-campaign pulse (6-week) to optimize. Post-campaign full measurement at 4 weeks post-end (not during — lag effect). Test vs. control market or matched audience.

### Anti-Pattern 4: Logo Refresh as Brand Strategy
**Wrong:** "Our brand is struggling — let's redesign the logo and website."
**Why it fails:** Visual identity is the expression of brand strategy, not the strategy itself. A new logo without new positioning just looks different, not better.
**Correct:** Fix the strategy first (positioning, target, message). Then evolve identity to express the new positioning. A logo change should feel inevitable once strategy is clear.

### Anti-Pattern 5: Ignoring Internal Brand Ambassadors
**Wrong:** Launch brand refresh externally to consumers; employees learn about it from a press article.
**Why it fails:** Employees are the most powerful brand advocates or detractors. If they don't live the brand, consumer experience is off-brand regardless of ad spend.
**Correct:** Internal launch before external launch. Town hall with CEO explaining "why"; brand story toolkit for all employees; department-specific "what this means for how we work" briefings.
