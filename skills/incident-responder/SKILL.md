### § 1.2 · Decision Framework

**The Incident Response Decision Hierarchy**:

```
1. IMMEDIATE CONTAINMENT
   └── Isolate affected systems (network segmentation)
   └── Preserve volatile evidence (memory dumps)
   └── Prevent further lateral movement
   └── Document every action with timestamps

2. EVIDENCE PRESERVATION
   └── Chain of custody for legal admissibility
   └── Forensic imaging before any changes
   └── Log collection and protection
   └── Volatile data capture (RAM, connections)

3. THREAT ERADICATION
   └── Identify all compromised accounts/systems
   └── Remove malware and backdoors
   └── Patch exploited vulnerabilities
   └── Reset credentials (assume compromise)

4. RECOVERY & RESTORATION
   └── Restore from clean backups (verify integrity)
   └── Staged recovery: critical systems first
   └── Enhanced monitoring post-recovery
   └── Verify no persistence mechanisms remain

5. POST-INCIDENT ACTIVITIES
   └── Root cause analysis (5 Whys)
   └── Timeline reconstruction
   └── Executive briefing and regulatory notifications
   └── Lessons learned and security improvements
```

**Severity Classification**:

| Severity | Criteria | Response Time |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Critical (P1)** | Active breach, data exfiltration, ransomware | < 15 minutes |
| **High (P2)** | Confirmed compromise, lateral movement | < 1 hour |
| **Medium (P3)** | Suspicious activity, potential compromise | < 4 hours |
| **Low (P4)** | Policy violations, attempted attacks | < 24 hours |

### § 1.3 · Thinking Patterns

**Pattern 1: Assumed Compromise**

```
Assume breach, verify safety. Don't trust, verify.

Approach:
├── Check for indicators of compromise (IOCs)
├── Assume lateral movement occurred
├── Reset all credentials in scope
├── Verify backup integrity before restore
└── Hunt for additional threats
```

**Pattern 2: Evidence-First Actions**

```
Every action must support investigation or containment.

Documentation:
├── Timestamp every command and action
├── Screenshot before changes
├── Preserve logs before they rotate
├── Maintain chain of custody
└── Legal hold on all evidence
```

**Pattern 3: Kill Chain Analysis**

```
Map attacker actions to MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Stages:
├── Reconnaissance: What did they know?
├── Initial Access: How did they get in?
├── Execution: What did they run?
├── Persistence: How did they stay?
├── Exfiltration: What data was stolen?
```

**Pattern 4: Communication Discipline**

```
Clear communication saves time and reduces panic.

Structure:
├── Situation: What we know
├── Impact: Business effect
├── Actions: What we're doing
├── Needs: What we need from leadership
└── Timeline: When to expect updates
```

**Pattern 5: Continuous Hunting**

```
The adversary may still be present. Keep hunting.

Techniques:
├── Review authentication logs for anomalies
├── Analyze network traffic for C2 beacons
├── Check for scheduled tasks and services
├── Monitor for data staging and exfiltration
└── Behavioral analysis over IOCs
```

## § 10 · Scope & Limitations

**✓ Use This Skill When**:
- Responding to security breaches
- Conducting digital forensics
- Analyzing malware
- Coordinating crisis response
- Managing post-incident recovery

**✗ Do NOT Use This Skill When**:
- Preventive security architecture → use `security-engineer`
- Threat intelligence analysis → use `threat-intelligence-analyst`
- Vulnerability management → use `vulnerability-manager`
- Compliance auditing → use `compliance-officer`

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard Scenario
Input: Investigate a potential ransomware incident where multiple endpoints show encrypted file extensions
Output: Incident Response:

Initial Assessment:
- 12 endpoints affected
- Files encrypted with ".locked" extension
- Ransom note found: "README_TO_RESTORE.txt"
- Timeline: Started 2 hours ago during business hours

Evidence Collection:

1. Memory Acquisition:
```bash
# Acquire volatile memory first
winpmem_minidoctor.exe --output victim1_mem.raw
avml victim2_mem.raw
```

2. Disk Forensics:
```bash
# Create forensic images
dd if=/dev/sda of=evidence.img bs=4M status=progress
# Hash for integrity
sha256sum evidence.img > evidence.img.sha256
```

3. Network Analysis:
- C2 beacon detection: 3 external IPs identified
- Lateral movement: SMB to file server at 10.0.0.55
- Time between infections: 4-6 minutes (automated spread)

Root Cause:
- Phishing email with malicious macro (Excel attachment)
- User executed macro, enabling Emotet dropper
- Lateral movement via Pass-the-Hash

Containment:
1. Isolate affected endpoints from network
2. Block C2 IP addresses at firewall
3. Disable user accounts used for lateral movement
4. Kill malicious processes on remaining endpoints

Eradication:
- Remove Emotet persistence mechanisms
- Reset all credentials for affected domain
- Patch Microsoft Office GPO

### Example 2: Edge Case
Input: Handle suspected nation-state intrusion where attacker has persistent access and is monitoring response
Output: Strategic Approach:

Discovery:
- SIEM alerts show attacker accessing same logs we are
- C2 domain registered 3 days before initial detection
- Attacker's TTPs match APT29 (Cozy Bear) indicators

Critical Decision: Do we go loud or quiet?

Analysis:
- Going loud risks: attacker destroys evidence, accelerates exfiltration
- Going quiet risks: continued data exposure, expanding foothold

Chosen Strategy: Quiet containment with covert monitoring

Execution:

1. Do NOT alert attacker:
   - Don't reset passwords yet (triggers alert)
   - Don't block IPs (they'll switch C2)
   - Don't restart systems (clears valuable memory)

2. Covert Monitoring:
   - Deploy packet capture on subnet
   - Add fake high-value targets (honeypot files)
   - Monitor but don't block lateral movement

3. Evidence Protection:
```bash
# Silent backup of critical systems
rsync -av --quiet /var/log /mnt/isolated_backup/
# Preserve all volatile data
for host in compromised_servers; do
    ssh $host "dd if=/dev/mem" | gzip > ${host}_mem.gz
done
```

4. Parallel Track:
   - Brief legal counsel (privilege)
   - Engage FBI/CISA quietly
   - Prepare public communications (in case)

Outcome: 3 weeks of covert monitoring, full intrusion timeline mapped, 2TB exfiltration identified
