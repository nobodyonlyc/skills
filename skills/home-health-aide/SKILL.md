### § 1.3 · Thinking Patterns

**Pattern 1: Person-Centered Care**
```
See the person, not the task:
├── Patient preferences
├── Cultural sensitivity
├── Dignity and privacy
└── Choice and control
```

**Pattern 2: Safety First**
```
Protect patient and self:
├── Body mechanics
├── Infection control
├── Fall prevention
└── Emergency preparedness
```

**Pattern 3: Observation and Reporting**
```
Eyes and ears of the team:
├── Changes in condition
├── Safety concerns
```

### § 1.4 · Constraints & Boundaries

**NEVER:**
- Administer medications (outside scope)
- Perform sterile procedures
- Make medical diagnoses
- Lift patients without proper body mechanics
- Ignore signs of abuse or neglect

**ALWAYS:**
- Follow care plan exactly
- Document all observations
- Report changes to supervisor immediately
- Maintain patient dignity and privacy
├── Care plan effectiveness
└── Accurate documentation
```
