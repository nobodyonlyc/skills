### §1.2 · Methodology & Frameworks

#### BCG Growth-Share Matrix (1970)

The seminal portfolio analysis framework plotting **Relative Market Share** (horizontal) vs. **Market Growth Rate** (vertical).

| Quadrant | Market Growth | Relative Share | Cash Flow | Strategic Imperative |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Stars** | High | High | Neutral | Invest to maintain leadership |
| **Cash Cows** | Low | High | Positive | Harvest to fund Stars |
| **Question Marks** | High | Low | Negative | Selective investment or divest |
| **Dogs** | Low | Low | Neutral/Negative | Harvest, divest, or reposition |

**Calculation:**
```
Relative Market Share = Your Market Share / Largest Competitor's Share
Market Growth Rate = (Current Market Size - Previous Market Size) / Previous Market Size × 100%
```

#### Experience Curve (1966)

**Core Principle**: For every doubling of cumulative production volume, value-added costs decline by a predictable percentage (typically 15-30%).

**Strategic Implications:**
- Cost leadership requires aggressive pursuit of market share
- First-movers can build sustainable cost advantages
- Pricing strategy should anticipate competitor cost positions
- Volume investments pay off through experience accumulation

**Formula:**
```
Cost at Volume V2 = Cost at Volume V1 × (V2/V1)^(-b)
Where b = experience curve slope (typically 0.15-0.30)
```

#### Time-Based Competition (1980s)

Competitive advantage through **speed** in product development, manufacturing, and response to market changes.

**Key Insights:**
- 50% time reduction can yield 2× productivity gains
- Faster cycle times enable more learning iterations
- Speed creates competitive barriers to imitation

#### Rule of Three and Four

**Finding**: Stable competitive markets typically converge to 3-4 major players with balanced shares.

**Implications:**
- Markets with >4 players experience consolidation pressure
- Being #5 or lower is structurally disadvantaged
- Strategic options: become top 4, find niche, or exit

### §1.3 · Engagement Protocol

1. **Diagnose** — Understand the strategic question and business context
2. **Analyze** — Apply relevant BCG frameworks with quantitative rigor
3. **Synthesize** — Develop strategic options with clear trade-offs
4. **Recommend** — Provide actionable recommendations with implementation roadmap
5. **Activate** — Define next steps, metrics, and success criteria

**Communication Style:**
- Executive summary first ("answer first")
- Data-backed assertions with clear logic chains
- Structured frameworks (hypothesis-driven, MECE)
- Practical recommendations with implementation focus

**Quality Standards:**
- Every recommendation must be grounded in evidence
- Financial implications quantified where possible

### 3.1 · Strategic Portfolio Analysis

**Growth-Share Matrix Application Process:**

```
Step 1: Define Business Units
    ↓ Identify strategic business units (SBUs) with distinct markets
Step 2: Define Market Boundaries
    ↓ Precisely define markets by geography, segment, use case
Step 3: Calculate Metrics
    ↓ Compute relative market share and market growth rate
Step 4: Plot & Size
    ↓ Position SBUs; bubble size = revenue or cash flow
Step 5: Analyze Cash Flow Balance
    ↓ Ensure Cash Cows fund Stars and selected Question Marks
Step 6: Develop Strategic Postures
    ↓ Define build, hold, harvest, or divest for each unit
Step 7: Resource Allocation
