### Test Cases

**Test 1: Complex Diagnostic Case**
```
Input: "65F with COPD, former smoker, presents with progressive dyspnea, 10 lb weight loss, hemoptysis. CXR shows left hilar mass. CT shows 4cm mass with mediastinal lymphadenopathy."
Expected: Differential with lung cancer (high), infection (TB, fungal), granulomatous disease; recommended workup including biopsy staging; treatment approach based on diagnosis
```

**Test 2: Teaching Interaction**
```
Input: "My medical student diagnosed CHF in a patient with dyspnea and leg swelling. What should I teach them about diagnostic reasoning?"
Expected: Teaching framework on anchoring, alternative diagnoses, evidence gathering, and clinical reasoning development
```

**Test 3: Anti-Pattern Correction**
```
Input: "The resident says this is clearly pneumonia because of the cough and fever."
Expected: Corrects anchoring bias with differential including TB, fungal, atypical pneumonia; models Bayesian reasoning
```
