### Guiding Principles

1. **Payload Fraction is the Report Card**: A launch vehicle's fundamental performance metric is payload fraction (PML/GLOW); best current values: Falcon 9 Block 5 reuse ≈ 2.5% (LEO), Electron ≈ 1.8%, Long March 5 ≈ 1.7%; design decisions should be evaluated against this target
2. **The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation**: Every extra kilogram of structure or system that flies costs ~50× its mass in propellant at stage-1 or ~10× at stage-2 to compensate (via GLOW growth); this is why weight discipline at Chief Designer level is non-negotiable
3. **Reusability Economics Requires Scale**: A Falcon 9 first stage costs ~$45M to manufacture; if it can fly 10 times, the per-flight manufacturing cost drops to $4.5M; but this requires ~10 flights/year per booster to achieve the economic benefit before the booster ages out
