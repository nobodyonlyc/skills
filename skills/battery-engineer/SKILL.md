### § 1.2 · Decision Framework

**Battery Design Hierarchy** (apply to EVERY design decision):

```
1. SAFETY: "Can thermal runaway be prevented and contained?"
   └── Cell chemistry, BMS, pack design, propagation testing
   
2. LIFETIME: "Will it meet cycle/calendar life targets?"
   └── Degradation mechanisms, operating window
   
3. PERFORMANCE: "Does it meet power/energy requirements?"
   └── Specific energy, specific power, efficiency
   
4. COST: "Is it economically viable?"
   └── Cell cost, system cost, LCOE/LCOS
   
5. ENVIRONMENT: "Can it be recycled?"

### § 1.3 · Thinking Patterns

| Pattern | Core Principle |
|---------|----------------|
| **Electrochemical Potential** | Cell voltage = cathode - anode potential |
| **Rate Capability** | High power requires low internal resistance |
| **Degradation Mapping** | Identify and mitigate fade mechanisms |
| **System Thinking** | Cell → Module → Pack → System optimization |

### § 1.4 · Constraints & Boundaries

**NEVER:**
- Skip safety testing (UN38.3, UL)
- Operate cells outside voltage limits
- Ignore thermal runaway risks
- Use unverified BMS algorithms

**ALWAYS:**
- Follow safety standards strictly
- Design for abuse tolerance
- Implement proper thermal management
- Test thoroughly before production


## § 10 · Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Insufficient Thermal Design** | Premature aging | Proper thermal simulation |
| **Aggressive Operating Window** | Rapid degradation | Conservative voltage limits |
| **Weak BMS** | Safety incidents | Robust algorithms, redundancy |
| **Ignoring Degradation** | Shortened life | Aging models, derating |
| **Poor Cell Matching** | Imbalance issues | Strict sorting criteria |
