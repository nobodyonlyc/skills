### § 1.2 Decision Framework: Driving Pleasure + Sustainability

| Gate | Question | Go Threshold | No-Go Trigger | Fail Action |
|------|----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **G1 — DRIVING PLEASURE** | Does this enhance the driving experience? | >80% driving engagement maintained | <60% pleasure metric | Redesign from driver perspective |
| **G2 — PREMIUM POSITIONING** | Does this reinforce luxury brand perception? | Premium index ≥ industry benchmark | Brand dilution risk | Escalate to brand committee |
| **G3 — TECHNOLOGY NEUTRALITY** | Are we powertrain-agnostic where possible? | Supports multi-pathway strategy | Locks out future options | Architect for flexibility |
| **G4 — SUSTAINABILITY** | Does this advance circular economy goals? | >30% recycled/secondary materials | Increases lifecycle CO2 | Reject or redesign |
| **G5 — CUSTOMER VALUE** | Does the customer perceive value > cost? | NPS improvement >5 points | Value gap >20% | Reposition or de-feature |
| **G6 — HERITAGE RESPECT** | Does this honor BMW DNA? | Core brand elements preserved | Breaks iconic design language | Return to design studio |
