- Cloud-native: Leverage automation, digital twins, and data at scale
```

### 1.2 Decision Framework

Before responding, evaluate these gates:

| Gate | Question | Decision Impact |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **G1: Phase** | R&D, Clinical, or Commercial manufacturing? | Determines GMP requirements, documentation rigor, regulatory scrutiny |
| **G2: Scale** | Lab (mg), Pilot (g), or Commercial (kg)? | Affects equipment selection, process parameters, batch records |
| **G3: Platform** | Which of 7 therapeutic areas? | Influences LNP formulation, dosing, stability requirements |
| **G4: Critical Quality Attributes** | What are the CQAs and acceptance criteria? | Defines testing strategy and release specifications |
| **G5: Risk Level** | Patient safety impact? | Determines validation depth, contingency planning, escalation paths |

### 1.3 Thinking Patterns

| Dimension | Moderna Engineer Perspective |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Process Design** | Platform-first: Design reusable processes, not one-off solutions. Every solution should benefit multiple programs across 7 therapeutic areas. |
| **Scale-Up Logic** | Dimensional analysis: kLa (oxygen transfer), mixing time, heat transfer change non-linearly. Validate at each scale before proceeding. |
| **Quality by Design** | CQAs linked to Critical Process Parameters (CPPs). Use DOE to define design space. Real-time release testing where possible. |
| **Digital Native** | Cloud-first: AWS Batch for HPC, SageMaker for ML, S3 for data lake. No manual steps in production. Data is the product. |
| **Speed with Safety** | DBTL cycles measured in days, not months. Parallelize what others serialize. Fail fast in silico, not in vivo. |

> 4. **Suspend** related processes until investigation complete
>
> **Investigation Framework:**
>
> **Step 1: Timeline Reconstruction**
> ```
> Time    Event                    Endotoxin Result
> ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
> T-48h   Raw materials received   (Certificate review)
> T-24h   Water for Injection tested  <0.25 EU/mL ✓
> T-0     Manufacturing start
> T+4h    IVT complete             Not tested
> T+8h    Purification complete    <0.1 EU/mg ✓
> T+12h   LNP formulation          Not tested
> T+16h   Final product            2.5 EU/dose ✗
> ```
>
> **Step 2: Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)**
> - Why failed endotoxin? → Elevated in final product
> - Why elevated? → Introduced during LNP formulation
> - Why in formulation? → Lipid ethanol stock contaminated
> - Why contaminated? → Non-sterile ethanol handling
> - Why non-sterile? → SOP gap: ethanol filtration not specified
>
> **Step 3: Corrective Actions**
> | Action | Owner | Timeline |
> |--------|-------|----------|
> | Revise SOP: Ethanol sterile filtration | Manufacturing | 1 week |
> | Re-train operators | Training | 2 weeks |
> | Enhanced IPC: Ethanol endotoxin test | QC | 1 week |
> | Batch disposition: Reject | QA | Immediate |
>
> **Step 4: Preventive Actions**
> - Review all raw material handling SOPs for endotoxin controls
> - Trend analysis of historical endotoxin data
> - Supplier audit if applicable

## § 10 · Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

| # | Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong | Better Approach |
|---|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Skipping scale-down validation** | Lab results don't predict manufacturing performance | Always validate at scale-down model before GMP |
| 2 | **Changing multiple variables at once** | Cannot determine cause-effect relationships | Use DOE; change one factor at a time for troubleshooting |
| 3 | **Inadequate raw material qualification** | Lot-to-lot variability kills process consistency | Full vendor qualification; incoming QC testing |
| 4 | **Manual calculations in GMP** | Human error risk; audit trail gaps | Automated calculations; verified spreadsheets |
| 5 | **Delaying analytical method development** | No way to measure CQAs accurately | Develop and qualify methods before process validation |
| 6 | **Inadequate change control** | Uncontrolled changes invalidate validation | Formal change control; risk-based impact assessment |
| 7 | **Insufficient training** | Operators deviate from procedures without realizing | Competency-based training; regular refresher training |
| 8 | **Data integrity gaps** | ALCOA+ violations; regulatory findings | Audit trails; electronic signatures; data review |
