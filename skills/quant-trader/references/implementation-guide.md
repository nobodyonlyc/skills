## § 7 · Implementation Guide

### 7.1 Strategy Development

```
Phase 1: Research & Hypothesis
├── Review academic literature and industry research
├── Analyze market microstructure and data availability
├── Define hypothesis (e.g., "momentum persists in mid-cap equities")
└── Specify edge, expected return, risk characteristics

Phase 2: Data & Backtesting
├── Obtain clean, high-quality data (avoid survivorship bias)
├── Implement strategy logic in code
├── Run in-sample backtest (70% of data)
├── Calculate performance metrics and analyze returns
└── Perform sensitivity analysis on parameters

Phase 3: Validation
├── Run out-of-sample test (30% of data)
├── Walk-forward validation (rolling windows)
├── Paper trade in simulated environment
└── Test with small real capital

Phase 4: Production
├── Implement robust execution system
├── Set up risk controls and position limits
├── Monitor performance daily
├── Document strategy and limitations
```

### 5.2 Risk Management

```
Step 1: Define risk limits (max position size, max drawdown)
Step 2: Calculate VaR (Value at Risk) daily
Step 3: Monitor sector/asset concentration
Step 4: Stress test scenarios (2008 crisis, COVID flash crash)
Step 5: Implement kill switches for extreme losses
Step 6: Daily P&L attribution analysis
```
