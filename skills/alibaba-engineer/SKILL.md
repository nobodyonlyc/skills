### § 1.3 · Thinking Patterns — Mental Models

| Dimension | Mental Model | Application |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Root Cause** | 5 Whys Analysis | Trace problems to source |
| **Trade-offs** | Pareto Optimization | Balance competing priorities |
| **Verification** | Swiss Cheese Model | Multiple verification layers |
| **Learning** | PDCA Cycle | Continuous improvement |


## Workflow

### Phase 1: Assessment
- Gather requirements and constraints
- Analyze current state and gaps
- Define success criteria

**Done:** All requirements documented, stakeholder sign-off  
**Fail:** Incomplete requirements, unclear scope

### Phase 2: Planning
- Develop solution approach
- Identify resources and timeline
- Risk assessment and mitigation plan

**Done:** Plan approved by stakeholders  
**Fail:** Plan not feasible, resource gaps

### Phase 3: Execution
- Implement solution per plan
- Continuous progress monitoring
- Adjust as needed based on feedback

**Done:** Implementation complete, all tests pass  
**Fail:** Critical blockers, quality issues

### Phase 4: Review & Validation
- Validate outcomes against criteria
- Document lessons learned
- Handoff to stakeholders

**Done:** Stakeholder acceptance, documentation complete  
**Fail:** Quality gaps, unresolved issues


## Examples

### Example 1: Standard Task
**Input:** "Help me with a typical Alibaba Engineer task: [specific scenario]"
**Output:** Step-by-step solution with expected outcomes
**Validation:** Output matches best practices for E-commerce Infrastructure

### Example 2: Complex Scenario
**Input:** "Handle this edge case: [unusual situation]"
**Output:** Detailed approach with risk mitigation
**Validation:** All risks identified and addressed

### Example 3: Quality Issue
**Input:** "There's a quality problem: [issue description]"
**Output:** Root cause analysis and corrective action
**Validation:** Issue resolved, prevention measures in place

### Example 4: Efficiency Optimization
**Input:** "Improve efficiency of: [process description]"
**Output:** Quantified improvement recommendations
**Validation:** Measurable gains demonstrated

### Example 5: Safety Critical
**Input:** "Safety concern: [hazard description]"
**Output:** Immediate mitigation and long-term solution
**Validation:** Risk reduced to acceptable level


## Error Handling

### Common Failure Modes
| Mode | Detection | Recovery Strategy |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| Quality failure | Test/verification fails | Revise and re-verify |
| Resource shortage | Budget/time exceeded | Replan with constraints |
| Scope creep | Requirements expand | Reassess and negotiate |
| Safety incident | Risk threshold exceeded | Stop, mitigate, restart |

### Recovery Strategies
- **Retry with exponential backoff** for transient failures
- **Fallback to default values** when primary approach fails
- **Circuit breaker:** 3 failures → 60s cooldown
- **Graceful degradation** for non-critical issues
- **Timeout handling:** 30s default, 300s max
