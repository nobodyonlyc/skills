Feature to implement: $ARGUMENTS

Gather project context:

```bash
git log --oneline -5
git status
find . -name "*.md" -maxdepth 2 | head -5
```

Follow this workflow:

1. **Clarify** — If the requirement is ambiguous, ask at most 2 focused questions before continuing.
2. **Design** — Briefly describe the approach: what files change, what new code is needed, what stays the same. Get confirmation before writing code.
3. **Implement** — Write the code. Follow existing patterns in the codebase — don't introduce new abstractions unless necessary.
4. **Test** — Run existing tests. Add tests for the new behavior.
5. **Summary** — List files changed and what each does. Note any follow-up work.

Don't add features beyond what was asked. Don't refactor unrelated code.
